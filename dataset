        "patient": "A 34-year old woman was referred for consideration of percutaneous ASD closure. The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187. The patient remained well with no evidence of residual shunt six months following the procedure.",

        "patient": "A 31-year old woman was found to have a secundum ASD during investigations for breathlessness. The defect was estimated to be 10 mm wide on TTE with evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. Left atrial size was normal. She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm. The inferior defect was closed using a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure ). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 727. The patient remained well and at six month follow-up there was no evidence of residual shunt.",

TEE suggested that the atrial septum was fenestrated with a small inferior rim of tissue and she was referred for device closure. At cardiac catheterisation it became clear that there were two principal defects, one in the fossa ovalis and the other situated inferior and posterior between the fossa ovalis and the coronary sinus. The superior hole was closed with a 16 mm Amplatzer septal occluder but failed to cover the inferior defect. A 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder device was subsequently placed successfully across the inferior defect with a stable position (figure ). Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the procedure was 124. Subsequent follow-up revealed a small left to right shunt between the two septal occluders but further intervention was not considered necessary.",

        "title": "A unique dedifferentiated tumor of the retroperitoneum",
        "patient": "A 65-year-old male presented with a three-week history of progressively worsening abdominal distension. He denied any abdominal pain but stated that he noticed an increased frequency of bowel movements. His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile and had a hugely distended abdomen with an immobile, nontender mass occupying all four quadrants of the abdomen. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a large, heterogeneous lobulated mass occupying most of the abdomen (Figure ). The peripheral component appeared lipomatous and the margins of this component were difficult to estimate accurately. There was also a heterogeneous nonlipomatous component that contained areas of lesser density, as well as a central stellate region of calcifications. The preoperative differential diagnosis included a retroperitoneal sarcoma (especially dedifferentiated liposarcoma), desmoid tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoid or sclerosing mesenteritis; lymphoma was also considered.\nWhile neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation comprise a frequent approach for retroperitoneal sarcomas at our institution, the extent of the tumor made this approach unfeasible. Resection was therefore planned unless an intraoperative biopsy revealed lymphoma. Resection was accomplished through a T-type incision (Figure ), and entailed removal of the right kidney, terminal ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and the left spermatic cord structures, all of which were intimately attached to the mass. Encasement of the external iliac artery and vein was also encountered near the end of the procedure. This was not fully appreciated preoperatively, as that component of the tumor was so much less conspicuous on CT than the rest of the tumor, given its fatty consistency (Figure ). The mass was split in half to facilitate dissection from the iliac vessels. An anastomosis was constructed from descending colon to rectum. A transverse colon mucous fistula and an ileostomy were brought out, as the ileum was dusky at the end of the procedure.\nThe tumor was submitted for histological examination in two parts measuring, 30.0 \u00d7 10.0 \u00d7 6.5 cm and 32.0 \u00d7 20.0 \u00d7 10.0 cm, weighing 19.8 kg in total (Figure ). On gross examination the mass was variegated, with fleshy and solid cystic degeneration containing areas of osseous consistency. Microscopic examination revealed a juxtaposition of well differentiated liposarcoma and a spindle cell sarcoma with heterologous chondrosarcomatous elements consistent with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma (Figure ).\nThe patient was discharged from hospital on the seventh postoperative day. He was followed in the surgical oncology outpatient clinic monthly. Four months after resection the patient had a follow-up CT scan, which demonstrated an intra-abdominal recurrence consisting almost completely of a calcified, nonlipomatous tumor (Figure ). The patient died one month later.",

        "patient": "A 60 year old woman presented with a small swelling beneath the right ear lobe of 4 months duration. The swelling measured 2 \u00d7 1 cm placed in the superficial part of the parotid and was not fixed. There was no facial nerve palsy or palpable cervical nodes. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out which showed the lesion to be ACC []. The clinical staging was T1, N0, M0. The patient underwent a total conservative parotidectomy after metastatic work up. Histopathology revealed ACC with cribriform pattern and perineural invasion (Figure ). 60 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively to the parotid area and the neck. Patient was placed on regular follow-up. Three years after primary surgery, patient presented with heaviness and pain in the right hypochondrium of 15 days duration. Patient was anicteric and abdominal examination revealed firm nodular and non tender enlargement of the liver. There was no ascites. Surgical site and neck were clinically normal. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen revealed multiple metastatic lesions scattered in both lobes (Figure ). Liver function tests were normal and an US guided FNAC revealed metastatic ACC (Figure ). Since the lesions were multiple and scattered over both lobes of liver, surgical option was not considered and the patient was offered palliative chemotherapy which she declined. She developed pedal edema and abdominal distention 20 months after detection of liver metastasis. On clinical examination, patient was anicteric but liver had increased in size and abdomen showed evidence of a little free fluid. Chest CT scan was normal. Bone scan did not suggest any metastatic focus. Patient died a month later still without evidence of local recurrence or pulmonary metastasis.",

        "title": "Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis in a patient with endometriosis: case report and review of the literature",
        "patient": "A 33y/o woman with a history of endometriosis presented with complaints of chronic urticaria. The patient noted that the urticaria began at the age of 12, and did not seem to have any obvious trigger. Each individual lesion would last from 12\u201324 hours, and the entire episode would last 5\u201310 days. Lesions would usually start on the chest and then spread over the entire body. She had seen multiple physicians, including allergists and dermatologists, and had been treated with a variety of medications including certirizine, desloratadine, hydroxyzine, montelukast, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine without relief. Prednisone at high doses would provide temporary relief, and she had required multiple courses of prednisone over the past 20 years. In addition, she complained of occasional angioedema, usually at the same time as the hives but occasionally occurring when hives were not present. The patient also had acne that had been very difficult to control since her teenage years, and she noted that the acne would also respond to prednisone.\nMultiple lab tests over the years had been unremarkable. These included SSA/SSB, anti-Smith, ACE level, C3/C4, hepatitis B, ANA, anti double-stranded DNA, immunoglobulins, SPEP, C1 esterase inhibitor level and function, chemistry panel, liver tests, TSH, T4, thyroid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, ESR, and CBC. Skin biopsy of a lesion had been read as \"chronic urticaria\".\nUpon further questioning, it was learned that due to the patient's endometriosis, she had very irregular menstrual cycles in terms of length and timing. It was determined that the hives and/or angioedema would begin approximately 4 days prior to the onset of menses, and would last about 2 days into menses. The symptoms would not occur with every episode of menses. The patient's acne would often occur on her face during the urticarial episodes. Of note, the patient had 2 children, and during each pregnancy her hives, acne, and angioedema had been markedly improved. Because of her endometriosis, she had been started on Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) in her twenties. After 1 injection, she developed severe hives that lasted over 2 months and required multiple courses of prednisone. Due to the urticaria, Depo-Provera was discontinued after one injection. As the patient complained of acne, Ortho Tri-Cyclen (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) was initiated by her dermatologist. This treatment modality did not have any effect on the urticaria, angioedema, or acne.\nThe patient was evaluated in our clinic. Physical examination was essentially normal, and no hives were noted. Allergy skin testing was performed with progesterone 50 mg/mL in normal saline. Prick test was normal, but a full strength intradermal test revealed a 7 mm wheal with erythema. The histamine control showed a 9 mm wheal with erythema, and saline control was negative for wheal and erythema. Two healthy controls also underwent intradermal testing to exclude irritant reaction, and were found to be negative\nBased on the above results, the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. The patient was started on a GnRH agonist (nafarelin acetate nasal spray, 200 mcg twice a day). Within one month, she noted dramatic improvement in her urticaria and angioedema. Acne was still occasionally present, but much improved. She did complain of mild hot flashes, but felt these were tolerable.",

Physical examination revealed bilateral symmetric and enlarged palatine tonsils without abnormal surface change. There were no palpable cervical lymph nodes or B symptoms (fever, body weight loss and cold sweats). White and red blood cell counts, biochemistry and chest radiographs were within normal limits. The results of an overnight polysomnography (PSG) showed mean SaO2, 91%, minimal SaO2, 62%, and a desaturation index (\u2265 4%) of 61.8/h. The arousal index was 64.8/h and the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 66.0/h. Believing that the patient was suffering from severe OSA and hyperplastic palatine tonsils, he received UPPP.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and sleep apnea improved. PSG performed 4 months after surgery demonstrated that the RDI had reduced to 23.9/h. Pathology indicated small B cell lymphocytic lymphoma (Figure ,) with bone marrow involvement. During the whole course, the patient was free from B symptoms and no further abnormal lymphadenopathy was detected even after head and neck computed tomography (CT) and thallium scan (figure ). Chemotherapy was started after evaluation at the oncology clinic. The patient is doing well and is on regular follow-up in the ENT and oncology clinics.",

        "patient": "A 24-year-old man was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with a possible diagnosis of seizure disorder and sepsis. He had a past medical history of cerebral palsy and spastic quadriparesis. Three years ago, he had an ITB pump implanted for spasticity refractory to the high doses of oral baclofen. He had a significant improvement in spasticity, social and functional capacity in the past three years.\nLater, he developed some disorientation and increased spasticity. He was taken to a local physician who prescribed oral baclofen (120 mg daily in four divided doses) for his increased spasticity. He also advised him to have his ITB pump checked immediately. The following day, his spasticity increased even after taking oral baclofen. He developed multiple seizures and respiratory distress in the next 24-hour period. Subsequently, he was admitted in a local hospital where he was orally intubated and transferred to our ICU for aggressive management.\nOn presentation, his temperature was 104.6\u00b0F (40.3\u00b0C), heart rate 127 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 85/45 mm/Hg. His ventilator settings were: assist-control ventilation mode; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; tidal volume, 650 mL; positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), 5 cm H2O; and FiO2, 60%. His spontaneous respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% was noted on pulse oximetry. In the local hospital, he was documented to have a high fever of 107\u00b0F (41.6\u00b0C) and he had received intravenous lorazepam, phenytoin, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactem and dopamine. On physical examination, neurologically he was unconscious with decerebrate posturing and his Glasgow coma scale was 6. He had an absent corneal and gag reflexes. He was moving all four limbs in response to noxious stimuli. He was also noted to have an extreme spasticity in all four limbs. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower base. Cardiac examination was unremarkable. He had a palpable baclofen pump on abdominal wall and bowel sounds were heard. The differential diagnoses were septic shock, meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia.\nThe initial laboratory results showed serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 5250 U/L (Normal, 25\u2013235 U/L) and CPK-MB fraction 12.1 ng/ml (Normal, 0.5\u20136.3 U/L). Serum chemistry revealed sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 5.1 mmol/L, chloride 120 mmol/L, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dl. Hemogram showed white blood cell count 12.2 K/UL, hemoglobin 16.5 g/dl and platelet count 9 K/UL (Normal, 130\u2013400 K/UL). Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) 1128 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (AST) 1140 U/L, alkaline phophatase 90 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, prothrombin time 20.2 seconds (Normal, 10\u201312.5 seconds), and INR 2.0 (Normal, 0.9\u20131.1). Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Chest radiograph was normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed atelectasis of the left lung base. His CT scan of head did not show any acute infarct or bleeding. His initial management included intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, platelet transfusion, phenytoin, propofol and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone) for suspected meningitis and septic shock. He received intravenous lorazepam (4\u20138 mg every four hours) for his spasticity. Next day, his spasticity improved and an ITB specialist investigated his baclofen pump. His baclofen pump analysis revealed that it was stopped due to some programming error, which was restarted at a previously prescribed baclofen rate (260 \u03bcg/day).\nOn third hospital day, his serum CPK was 15,878 U/L, AST was 2566 U/L, ALT was 2993 U/L, while CPK-MB fraction came down to 3.4 ng/ml. His urine output decreased (<400 ml/ day) and serum creatinine increased in the range of 5\u20136 mg/dl. Later, he was hemodialyzed few times during the course of hospitalization due to acute renal failure. His echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20\u201325% and severe global hypokinesis. His electroencephalogram did not reveal any epileptogenic activity. He developed full-blown multisystem organ failure with an evidence of shock liver, renal failure, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myocardial depression. His nutrition was started on nasogastric tube feedings, and proper ventilator care was taken through a tracheostomy tube. His serum baclofen obtained at the time of admission was less than 0.02 \u03bcg/ml (Expected values, 0.08\u20130.4 \u03bcg/ml). After a three-week course of aggressive management in ICU, he was weaned off from the ventilator and his multiple organ shock resolved. At a six-month follow-up, he was observed in a nursing home with his baseline functional, social, and family activities.",

        "patient": "A 57-year-old man presented with sudden gastrointestinal tract bleeding and episode of fainting. Duodenoscopy (Figure ) and hypotonic duodenography (Figure ) revealed a 3 \u00d7 3 cm protruding tumor with two ulcerations located opposite the ampulla of Vater in the second part of the duodenum. Laboratory data showed no abnormalities in blood chemistry, tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, NSE, proGRP) and endocrine markers (somatostatin, gastrin, glucagons, serotonin, VIP) except a moderate anemia (9.5 g/dl hemoglobin). No abnormal findings were observed in the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT).\nA laparotomy was performed. As there was no serosal invasion or regional lymphadenopathy wide local excision of the tumor was performed. On gross examination, the tumor showed two ulcerations and two different morphological components (Figure and ). One component (component A) was round in shape with a round ulceration on the top, and the other component (component B), which enclosed the round component, was crescent in shape with a spindle-shaped ulceration on the top. The two components showed different histopathological and immunohistochemical features (Table ). The round component contained fibrous tissue, small nuclei, and clear nucleoli. Histopathologically, the crescent component had more anaplastic features typical of small-cell carcinoma, such as sheets of tightly packed anaplastic cells with round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm (Figure , ). Neuroendocrine differentiation was investigated using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Both components showed neuroendocrine features, with immunochemistry identifying synaptophysin and AE1/AE3 (Figure and ), and electron microscopy identifying dense core granules (Figure ). Immunochemistry also showed that the crescent component expressed less cytokeratin, vimentin and CD56, and more MIB-1 than the round component.\nThe patient was discharged three weeks after operation with uneventful postoperative period. Four cycles of monthly adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluoro uracil (5-FU) (325 mg/m2) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2) were administered. The patient showed no sign of recurrence and is disease-free 48 months after surgery.",

        "patient": "A 62-year-old woman with known metabolic syndrome was referred to our clinic to exclude coronary artery disease invasively. She has been experiencing chest pain for four months which has not increased in frequency or duration since it started. She denied pain at rest, nocturnal pain, difficulty breathing, or palpitations. An echocardiographic stress examination revealed significant ischemia with anteroseptal hypokinesia. Cardiac chambers were morphologically normal. The \"baseline\" echocardiography and stress echo was unsuspicious of a left atrial myxoma (Fig. ).\nCoronary angiography revealed coronary artery disease with a stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) near the left main stem. A stent was implanted in the proximal LAD with no residual stenosis. The ventricle was morphologically normal.\nA coronary angiography performed 13 months after stent implantation showed no re-stenosis and a normal left ventricle. No echocardiogram was performed at this time 32 months after the control coronary angiography, the patient was readmitted because of increasing dyspnoea and palpitations. A transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a big (70 \u00d7 30 mm) mass in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum. The tumor prolapsed into the left ventricle obstructing the mitral valve orifice (Fig ). The mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve was 8 mm Hg.\nA subsequent coronary angiography and LV and RV catheterization detected a mean diastolic pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg between the pulmonary capillary wedge and the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, and no re-stenosis of the LAD stent. The angiography was notable for a large area with small atypical, tortuous vessels in the region of the interatrial septum. These vessels were shown to originate from branches of the right coronary artery (RCA) and the circumflex coronary artery (RCX). (Fig. )\nSurgery was promptly performed and the tumor was successfully excised. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma.\nA retrospective analysis of the initial coronary angiographies (baseline, 13 and 45 months) disclosed the atypical vessels in a small area of interatrial septum (Fig. , , ).",

        "patient": "A 79-year-old male was referred in March 2003 with a lump on the left side of his neck. The patient had noted a sudden increase in the size of the lump over the preceding two months. He did not report any neck pressure symptoms, weight loss or anorexia. His past history included right partial thyroidectomy for a solitary nodule (colloid goitre) in 1978 and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1994. He had suffered myocardial infarction in 1995 and had an episode of acute coronary insufficiency in January 2003. His recent coronary angiograms showed an occluded left anterior descending artery and echocardiogram revealed good left ventricular function. He was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. He had been taking warfarin, diltiazem MR, lisinopril, uniphyllin, glyceryl trinitrate tablets and buccal suscard.\nOn examination he had left sided goitre extending superiorly into the posterior triangle and inferiorly into the retrosternal space, with variable consistency. The trachea was deviated to the right and there was cervical lymphadenopathy on the left side. Systemic examination was unremarkable and fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland showed presence of H\u00fcrthle cells. Computerised tomographic (CT) scan with contrast enhancement (figure &) of the neck and thorax revealed large left sided thyroid goitre with significant mediastinal extension. It showed mixed attenuation with foci of calcification peripherally. There was a 3 cm complex mass on the left side of the neck, posterior to the carotid sheath structures and deep to the sternomastoid, indicative of lymph node metastases. Thyroid profile and routine blood investigations were unremarkable.\nBased on the above findings radical surgery was planned. On exploration of the neck we confirmed left goitre with intrathoracic extension and enlarged lymph nodes under the sternocleidomastoid close to the jugulodigastric muscle and surrounding the carotid sheath. There was no remnant thyroid tissue seen on the right side following the previous thyroid surgery. Left hemithyroidectomy with modified neck dissection (lymphadenectomy, preserving all vessels and nerves) was performed. Macroscopic examination of the thyroid lobe showed a well defined solid pale brown mass approximately 8 cm in maximum dimension, surrounded by a narrow rim of preserved thyroid tissue. The lymph node specimen comprised of several nodules of partly necrotic tissue. Microscopic examination showed the thyroid lobe containing a H\u00fcrthle cell neoplasm, which was mostly encapsulated, with foci of capsular and vascular invasion. The two lymph nodes revealed metastatic H\u00fcrthle cell carcinoma. [pT3, N1a, Mx], (Figure &).\nThe patient had adjuvant therapy with oral radioiodine 131 (3060 MBq Sodium Iodine). He was put on a daily dose of 100 mcg of thyroxine. This was to be followed by a second dose of 5911 MBq of radioactive iodine six months from the time of the first dose.",

        "patient": "A 22-year-old homosexual male presented to hospital with progressive dyspnea, productive cough, generalized malaise and fever. He had a known history of intravenous cocaine abuse and recent serology in prior 3 months was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results of a physical examination showed signs of tachypnea, tachycardia, accessory muscle use and left lung base crackles. Tympanic temperature was 34.7\u00b0C. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable except for urethral meatus stenosis.\nInitial laboratory investigations are presented in Table . Arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.95, PaCO2 10 mmHg, PaO2 109 mmHg, HCO3 2 mmol/L, and lactate 0.6 mmol/L consistent with high anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 587 \u03bcmol/L and 46.7 mmol/L, respectively. Toxicology and drug screen was negative. The metabolic acidosis was partially accounted for by acute renal failure with retained unmeasured anions and ketonemia. Urinalysis showed pyuria. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.\nChest radiograph revealed right middle lobe and lingular patchy opacification. An abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated moderate to severe bilateral hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening with multiple diverticuli, and retroperitoneal streaking consistent with acute infection. A provisional diagnosis of severe sepsis was made with multiple potential foci of infection. The patient was given empiric ceftriaxone, metronidazole and vancomycin. Sputum specimen cultured heavy methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, blood cultures were positive for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Group B Streptococcus. Urine cultured greater than 108 CFU/L of multiple gram positive and negative organisms.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The metabolic acidosis persisted (pH 7.00) a despite 100 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion of three liters of normal bicarbonate solution (150 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL D5W). The patient had a suprapubic bladder catheter inserted by angiography. However, due to concern the patient remained oliguric following 4 L crystalloid resuscitation, hemodialysis was organized. Hemodialysis parameters included: F160 membrane (surface area 1.5 m2 and KUf 50 mL/hr/mmHg), dialysate sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3 mmol/L, calcium 1.25 mmol/L, bicarbonate 40 mmol/L, and QD 500 mL/min, QB 250\u2013300 mL/min via a 25 cm left femoral double-lumen Uldall catheter. The patient had 71.5 L of blood processed over four hours with no fluid removal. Although the patient was alert and appropriate (Glasgow Coma Scale 15) with tachycardia and stable normal range blood pressure before the initiation of dialysis, he was demonstrating an increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements suggestive of worsening sepsis syndrome. Approximately 2.5 hrs after start of dialysis the patient became rapidly unresponsive prompting intubation for airway protection. At completion of HD and over the subsequent 4 hours the patient's neurologic status deteriorated with evidence of loss of all brainstem reflexes. Head CT-scan is shown in Figure .\nRepeat laboratory investigations immediately following hemodialysis revealed a pH 7.36, HCO3 19 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, potassium 1.8 mmol/L, and urea 13.7 mmol/L (urea-reduction-ratio was 71%) (Table ).\nThe patient rapidly progressed to refractory shock and multi-organ dysfunction Diagnosis of brain death was declared independently by an intensivist and a neurologist. At autopsy, the brain showed evidence of diffuse cerebral edema. Cardiac assessment showed left ventricular enlargement consistent with systemic hypertension likely as a result of chronic kidney disease. Both lungs showed patchy acute bronchopneumonia with edema and congestion. Both kidneys appeared grossly pyonephrotic with dilated, thickened ureters and suggested the presence of acute on chronic pyelonephritis. The meatal aperture was scarred and stenosed.",

        "patient": "A 14-year-old boy was noticed to have had multiple white, non pruritic area on his distal extremities for two years. The lesions consisted of whitish papules and depressed areas with central protrusion.\nOn clinical examination, the otherwise healthy looking patient's general appearance and mental state had lumbar lordosis, laxity in large joints, tibia vara, high-arched palate, and dental misalignment. Skin lesions consisted of scattered, white to skin-colored papules, less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and with central protrusion, that were distributed on the dorsum of fingers (Fig ), forearms (Fig ), distal portion of the thighs and on the calves (Fig ). No lesions on the trunk or proximal areas of extremities were detected. Palms, soles, dorsum of feet and mucosal membranes were spared. No sensory changes associated with the lesions. He did not have any history of medication consumption. Family history was negative.\nLaboratory examinations consisting of complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood chemistry including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver function tests were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody was negative. The patient had no risk factor for AIDS or syphilis, so we did not request HIV or VDRL test. Hepatitis B surface antigens were not detected. Immunological assays consisting of IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE, C3, and C4 levels were normal. An induration of 0.5 centimeter in diameter was observed after tuberculin testing. Chest x-ray film was normal. The skin biopsy was done. Haematoxylin and eosin stained section showed faintly eosinophilic separated collagen fibers in the upper and mid-dermis (Fig ). Verhoeff-vanGieson stained sections showed a marked decrease or in some areas total absence of elastic fibres, in both superficial and mid-dermis. Elastic fibres around the vessels in the affected areas are also fragmented and markedly decreased (Fig ,). We tried to treat the patient with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy by means of cotton-tip applicator for two freeze-thaw cycles (freeze time, 10\u201315 seconds), in 6\u20138 sessions weekly; which obtained moderate improvement in some early-onset lesions with no frank atrophy (Fig and ).",

        "patient": "A 70 year-old woman with a one-month history of bilateral breast masses was referred to our cancer center for surgical evaluation. There was no associated breast pain, skin change or nipple discharge. There was no history of bone pain, weight loss, fatigue, fever or other systemic complaints and no family history of breast cancer. Significant past medical history included treatment for an extramedullary retrosternal plasmacytoma 5-years prior this admission.\nAt the time of the initial work-up for the retrosternal mass, immunoelectrophoresis showed no evidence for hyperproteinemia or paraproteinemia. Whole body bone scan was negative and a bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of plasma cells. Therefore, multiple myeloma was excluded by nuclear medicine, laboratory and histology studies. The patient underwent radiation therapy (40 Gy with fraction size of 200 cGy delivered over 4 weeks) followed by chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and prednisolone. The patient was followed by laboratory tests, chest roentgenography, and computed tomography annually. A bone scintigraphy was carried out after 2 years and showed no uptake patient was thereafter lost to follow-up.\nFive years after initial diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma the patient presented with bilateral breast masses. Physical examination revealed a 3.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm, mass in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast and a similar 5.0 cm \u00d7 4.5 cm mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast. No asymmetry, skin dimpling or signs of inflammation were present. There was no axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\nMammography confirmed a well-defined 3.2 cm oval-shaped mass in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast, and a lobulated 5.5 cm density in lower inner quadrant of the left breast without any tissue distortion, inflammation and fibrotic reaction.(Figure ) There were no microcalcification and satellite lesions. These masses were solid and hypoechoeic with multiple septations in sonography.\nExcisional biopsy of the masses revealed a 5.0 (left) and 3.0 (right) well-defined, capsulated gritty mass surrounded by normal breast tissue. There was no extension from the capsulated masses to pectoral muscles or chest wall. Histopathological examination showed high-grade tumors composed of immature and mature plasma cells. Mitosis, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism and binucleated and multinucleated plasma cells were seen. (Figure ) Additional studies such as serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis were normal. No Bence Jones or other M components were detected in the urine. Skeletal surveys (Tc99 bone scan and skull and pelvic X-rays) did not show any pathological changes. There was no evidence of anemia, hypercalcemia or renal insufficiency. However, the patient refused a second bone marrow biopsy.\nImmunohistochemical studies were performed on the paraffin embedded tissues to determine if the infiltrate had monoclonal character. The tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for lambda chains but negative for kappa chains. (Figure )\nThe tumor cells were weakly positive for monoclonal mouse anti human placental V538C, and plasma cell markers (CD138). Nuclear prognostic marker (Ki67) showed 50% to 80% nuclear expression indicative of high proliferative activity and suggesting a plasmacytic tumor with anaplastic components (Figure ). Other immunohistochemical stains including CD21, cytokeratin, S100, and HMB45 were negative.\nA retrospective microscopic review of the mediastinal mass showed similar morphology to the breast tumor. Hence, the histological diagnosis of recurrent plasmacytoma was made.\nThe patient was treated with oral Melfalan and Prednisone. The patient has been disease free for twenty months after treatment and has showed no evidence of recurrence in the mediastinum, breast or any other region.",

        "patient": "In Dec 2001, a 52 year old man, who was a known case of Multiple Myeloma (MM), was presented to one of our affiliated hospitals with persistent right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, and anorexia for a period of 1 month. At the time of admission, the patient had been receiving prednisolone and melphalan for his MM, which was currently in remission. His recent condition began with tongue and facial edema two weeks before appearance of the abdominal pain.\nUpon physical examination, mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable liver were found. Neither icterus nor any positive sign of cardiopulmonary abnormalities were noted. Additionally, the patient did not have a fever and his peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, white blood cell count of 10,800/mm3 with 18% eosinophils, and a sedimentation rate of 90 mm at the end of the first hour. The total bilirubin was 0.5 mg/dL (0.2\u20130.8 mg/dl), alanine aminotranferase (ALT) 48 IU/L (0\u201340 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 46 IU/L (0\u201340 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk P) 651 IU/L (60\u2013140 IU/L). The eosinophilia fluctuated between 12 to 55 percent in various tests performed during the time period in question, with no unique patterns noted. Serum electrophoresis showed a monoclonal spike in the gamma region. Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) produced a positive result for Fasciola hepatica, while the test was negative for Toxocara canis. Serologic tests for the presence of hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative. Blood and urine cultures were found to be sterile. Other laboratory studies, including repeated stool examinations for ova and parasites, showed no abnormalities. Chest x-rays did not demonstrate any parenchymal or pleural abnormality. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a mild hepatomegaly with multiple hypoechoic lesions in the liver. A CT scan revealed multiple but poorly defined, hypodense lesions in the liver, and a completely enlarged pancreas with mild bilateral pleural reaction, suggesting metastatic cancer (Fig. 1). In the search for a potential malignancy, diagnostic laprascopy was performed, which revealed the presence of white-colored lesions ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter on the surface of both lobes of the liver with mild ascites. Multiple liver and peritoneal biopsy specimens revealed fibrinoid necrosis, associated with granulomatous reaction and a high concentration of eosinophils in the liver, (Fig. 2) accompanied by markedly inflamed peritoneal tissue with eosniphilic infiltration. No malignant cells were identified and no evidence of extramedulary plasmocytoma was found. Specific staining for fungal organisms and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The ascitic fluid also had a high level of eosinophils. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) failed to show any filling defect within the biliary tree. Furthermore, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration that only indicated high eosniophilic infiltration. The patient was placed on albendazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 week). The treatment was well tolerated and the abdominal pain was improved rapidly. At the time of discharge, the patient was in good clinical condition. During a follow-up visit two months later, a second CT unexpectedly showed not only an increase in the number and size of the hypodense lesions in the liver, but also the extension of lesions into the pancreas, the spleen and both kidneys (Fig. 3). No evidence of peripheral enhancement of the hepatic lesions or ascites was documented. The patient was still experiencing upper quadrant pain on the right side. Laboratory investigations produced a white blood cell count of 7200/mm3 with 16% eosinophilia. Repeated stool examinations failed to identify ova and parasites. The patient was given triclabendazole (10 mg/kg, bid for two days). As recommended, the patient had another follow-up CT scan three months later. At that time all of his symptoms were resolved. Follow-up CT scans revealed a considerable improvement in the number and size of the lesions. At the time of the CT scan, all of his symptoms were resolved (Fig. 4A, B). At this time the WBC was 6000/mm3 with 6% eosinophils. After 5 months and in the last CT, the lesions had almost disappeared completely (Fig. 4C, D).",

The donor was a previously healthy, 42-year-old male, who suffered intracranial bleeding following a motor vehicle crash. He did not suffer any period of hypoxia but he was hypotensive (SBP = 90 mm Hg) prior to procurement. His serum liver function tests were normal prior to harvesting (AST 32 U/L, ALT 40 U/L). The organ was procured by our institution's transplant team. During procurement the liver was found to be well perfused with no focal injuries and no macroscopic evidence of steatosis.\nThe recipient underwent an uncomplicated conventional LT without the use of a veno-venous bypass. There were no periods of hypoxia or severe hypotension during transplantation. The cold ischemic time of the graft was 8 hours while the warm ischemic time was 45 minutes. The graft reperfused well and no biopsies were taken. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) was administered intraoperatively, and postoperatively the patient received induction with Antithymocyte Globulin, which is the protocol followed at our institution. During transplantation the patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).\nAt the time of LT, the international normalization ratio (INR) was 1.53, while serum total bilirubin was 103 \u03bcmol/L (Figure ). On postoperative day 2 the patient had a peak of his serum AST (3469 U/L) and at this point he had further biochemical evidence of primary graft dysfunction, with inability to normalize his INR (Figure ), and with progressive elevation of his total serum bilirubin (Figure ). Repeated ultrasonographic examination revealed a patent hepatic artery and portal vein, as well as patent hepatic veins. At this point, a liver biopsy demonstrated severe reperfusion injury with several apoptotic bodies, several dystrophic calcifications (Figure ), and no evidence of acute cellular rejection. His clinical status deteriorated, he developed multiorgan system failure and died 12 days after his transplantation. No septic focus was identified.

The patient did not have a history suggestive of hyperparathyroidism or abnormal calcium metabolism, and upon listing his serum ionized calcium was 0.94 mmol/L. The donor was a previously healthy, 52 year-old male who suffered a closed head injury during a motor vehicle crash. The organ was procured by our transplant team. Prior to procurement the donor did not suffer any periods of hypoxia or hypotension. His liver function tests were normal prior to harvesting (AST 36 U/L, ALT 45 U/L). During procurement the liver was found to be well perfused, with no evidence of aberrant vascular anatomy and no evidence of trauma. Macroscopic examination of the liver did not show any evidence of steatosis. The recipient underwent a conventional LT without venovenous bypass and without intraoperative hypotension. The cold ischemic time was 10 hours while the warm ischemic time was 40 minutes. Following reperfusion, the graft appeared well perfused and again no biopsies were taken. Intraoperatively the patient received 500 mg of methylprednisolone, and postoperatively he was induced with Antithymocyte Globulin. During transplantation the recipient received 3 units of PRBCs and 6 units of FFP. In the early postoperative period the patient had to be explored once for retroperitoneal bleeding associated with hypotension (SBP< 90 mm Hg).\nAt the time of LT, the patient had an INR of 2.7 and a serum total bilirubin of 104 \u03bcmol/L. Following LT, the patient developed severe primary graft dysfunction with rising serum bilirubin and INR (Figure ), while his serum ALT and AST peaked during the 2nd and 3rd postoperative day (4700 U/L and 6598 U/L respectively). At that time, ultrasonography demonstrated uniformly patent vessels (hepatic artery, portal and hepatic veins), while Computed Tomography (CT) showed areas in the right lobe of the liver isodense with the spinal column (Figure ). The patient was listed for retransplantation. During the retransplant procedure the explant liver graft had a \"bony\" consistency in the involved right lobe. Cross-sections of the right lobe showed a \"clay-like\" parenchyma with clear evidence of calcification (Figure ). Light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of ultrathin sections obtained from specimens selected from biopsies at the interface of calcified and non-calcified tissues showed extensive intracellular calcification within the hepatic cells (Figure ). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis demonstrated the presence of hydroxyapatite (HA) as a solid phase in the calcified region. The adjacent non- or partially calcified hepatic cells displayed extensive nuclear condensation suggestive of significant apoptosis as well as severe vacuolization, suggestive of an extensive apoptotic and necrotic process (Figure ).\nThe patient had a complicated postoperative course and finally died from ventricular fibrillation unresponsive to electrical cardioversion. Both kidneys harvested from the initial donor were transplanted without any evidence of delayed or primary graft dysfunction/non-function.",

        "patient": "A 29-year-old previously healthy immigrant male patient from Kazakhstan was admitted to hospital with new-onset severe hemoptysis, macroscopic hematuria and extensive cutaneous petechiae on lower extremities. He appeared ill and poorly nourished. The patient was oriented and well cooperated, and there was no previous history of hematologic or liver or another disease and recent medication. He presented with unexplained weight loss of 2 months duration along with intermittent fever, night sweats and cough. The physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 100/70 mm/Hg, pulse 100/min, a temperature 37.2\u00b0C, extensive cutaneous petechiae on lower extremities, hemorrhagic bulla on tongue and on mucosa of oral cavity, and amphoric souffl\u00e9 on apex of right chest. No organomegaly or lymphadenomegaly or evidence of another disease such as chronic liver disease was detectable. The initial complete blood count revealed a white blood cell 25.1 \u00d7 109/l (58% neutrophils, 29% bants, 9% lymphocytes and 4% monocytes), hemoglobin 11.2 gr/dl, hematocrit 36%, MCV 84 fl, reticulocytes 1% and platelet count 7.6 \u00d7 109/l. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 110 mm/h. A peripheral smear was remarkable for a paucity of platelets. Coagulation profile [prothrombin time (PT), activated-partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrin degradation products (FDP)] were normal. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated hypercellularity of all cell lines with normal maturation of myeloid and erythroid precursors. Megakaryocytes were increased in number with normal morphology. On bone marrow aspiration hemophagocytosis was not observed. A chest X-ray (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates and walled cavities on left and right upper lobes. Acid-fast bacilli were strongly positive in sputum (Figure ). Bone marrow aspirate and urine for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Sputum culture yielded mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The following laboratory studies were normal or negative: biochemical tests (glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, total protein and albumin), rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-platelet specific antibodies, Coomb's tests, HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, blood culture, bone marrow aspirate culture and abdominopelvic CT. No granuloma or hemophagocytosis was detected on bone marrow biopsy. The patient was started on rifampin 10 mg/kg/d, isoniazid 5 mg/kg/d, ethambutol 25 mg/kg/d, pyrazinamide 40 mg/kg/d, pyridoxine 75 mg/d and intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) 1 g/kg/d given for 2 days. On day 2 of hospitalization and treatment of anti-tuberculous therapy prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d was added. On day 8, platelet counts started to increase and on day 12 of the treatment it reached to 187 \u00d7 109/l level. Patient improved on day 10 and he did not have any complaints on day 14; at time of discharge. He received a total of 6 red blood cell (RBC) units throughout hospitalization. During his hospitalization findings of hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleeding and massive bleeding in another site except hematuria and hemoptysis were not established. A complete blood count at discharge demonstrated a WBC 17 \u00d7 109/l, Hb 9.6 g/dl, and platelet count 310 \u00d7 109/l (Table ). Corticosteroids were discontinued on day 14 of therapy and the patient was discharged and recurrent thrombocytopenia was not established after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. Ninety days after discharge, the patient was well with a platelet count of 300 \u00d7 109/l (Table ) and he had no side effect thought to be secondary to anti-tuberculous drugs.",

        "title": "Valgus and varus deformity after wide-local excision, brachytherapy and external beam irradiation in two children with lower extremity synovial cell sarcoma: case report",
        "patient": "At the time of diagnosis, this patient was an 8 year-old male with an approximate 12\u201324 month history of mild pain and swelling in the left popliteal region. There was no complaint of fever or decreased range of motion. He presented to a local orthopedist (April 1995) and was found to have a palpable abnormality on the posterior aspect of the knee consistent with a Baker's cyst. Aspiration was unsuccessful and the patient was treated with ibuprofen for a 10-day course. Nearly one year later (April 1996) the family sought a second opinion and an MR study was ordered that revealed a cystic structure [Figure ]. The patient returned to the original orthopedist and was found to have a painful and enlarging mass in the left popliteal region. He underwent resection of a solid and cystic mass (November 1996) measuring 7.0 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 3.0 cm. The tumor was described as a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. The extent of resection was incomplete with gross residual tumor remaining about the lateral aspect of the knee and external to the joint capsule which also appeared to be the site of origin. The patient was transferred one month later to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of his evaluation after referral, he had strong popliteal pulses. There was a 7.0 \u00d7 4.5 cm area of swelling and numbness in the left popliteal region. The deep-tendon reflexes were brisk and the motor exam and gait were normal. MR showed residual abnormality consistent with tumor lateral to the joint capsule. Metastatic work-up including nuclear bone scan and CT scan of the chest was negative. Tumor bed re-excision with placement of afterloading catheters was performed in December 1996. All visible residual abnormality was removed without significant disruption of underlying ligaments and tendons. The walls of the tumor bed were biopsied to map the extent of microscopic residual disease. Microscopic residual disease was anticipated given the site of involvement and the limited ability to operate beyond the extent of the abnormal appearing tissues. Eleven afterloading catheters were placed in a parallel array to cover the tumor bed [Figure ]. Radio-opaque clips were placed at the site of the biopsies and to demarcate the extent of the tumor bed for brachytherapy planning. The final pathology confirmed the presence of residual tumor in the operative specimen and microscopically involved margins at the central and superomedial aspects of the tumor bed.\nFive days after surgery, the 11 catheters were loaded with a total of 135 seeds representing 408 millicuries of I125. The dwell time of the implant was 64 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2560 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Three weeks later, the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy per day and received a total external beam dose of 4860 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered in a parallel-opposed beam arrangement using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in February 1997.\nA decision was made to initiate chemotherapy three weeks into the course of external beam irradiation based on the perceived high-risk nature of his case \u2013 longstanding history of symptoms, known residual tumor and size of tumor at presentation. Chemotherapy included vincristine, ifosfamide, and adriamycin was eventually administered for a total of four cycles. There was central dehiscence of the wound prior to the completion of radiation therapy. The wound was colonized with Enterococci sensitive to ampicillin and managed with antibiotics, whirlpool treatment and daily dressing changes. There was a one-week treatment break during the external beam portion of the treatment.\nAt the completion of chemotherapy (June 1997) the patient underwent excision of scar tissue with rotation flap of gastrocnemius and skin and Z-plasty of the semi-membranous and semi-tendinous tendon for a non-healing ulcer in the operative region. There was also contracture of the knee joint without signs of abscess or cellulitis. One month later, a second procedure was required to debride and irrigate the left popliteal fossa wound at the site of previously irradiated tissue and contracture release with muscle and fasciocutaneous flap closure. One year after the completion of all therapy (June 1998) the patient reported full range of motion and softening of previously fibrotic tissue. He was actively playing baseball and had no imposed limitations.\nNearly two years after completion of treatment (March 1999), the patient was noted to have Trendelenburg gait after prolonged walking ascribed to poor endurance of weakened hip abductors bilaterally. Hip hiking was also noted on the contralateral side due to leg length and ASIS height discrepancy. A difference of 2.5 cm was noted when measured from the umbilicus to the medial malleolus. He had grown 7.0 cm since the time of diagnosis. He was instructed to stretch the heel cord and strengthening his weak hip abductors. Arrangements were made to provide a shoe lift to accommodate the leg length difference. The discrepancy improved to less than 1 cm over a three month period of time (March-June 1999). He was carefully monitored for growth discrepancy and 6 months later, nearly 3 years after the initiation of treatment, the discrepancy returned to its original value of greater than 2 cm. He also had difficulty with ambulation with slight left-sided limp. Orthopedic surgery was re-consulted. The discrepancy was followed and treated with additional shoe lift. The patient continued to engage in normal activities including sports and reported full range of motion and normal strength. More than four and a half years after initiating treatment (August 2001) [Figure ], x-ray scanogram revealed estimated lengths of 49.0 cm and 46.5 cm for his right and left femora respectively, and 40.7 cm and 37.0 cm for his right and left tibiae respectively [Figure ]. There was a clinically noticeable varus deformity of the left knee. All growth plates were still open radiographically. He was taken to surgery five years after the initiation of definitive therapy (December 2001) [Figure ] for a panepiphysiodesis of the right leg. Using an image intensifier to locate the distal femoral growth plate, medial and lateral incisions were made and a wire-guided cannulated reamer was used to obliterate the plate. The same procedure was done to the proximal tibial growth plate. There were no complications from surgery and the wounds healed appropriately. He was started on physical therapy including quad sets to maintain adequate range of motion. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastatic disease nearly seven years after treatment. There are no limitations regarding activities and there has been no progressive angular growth deformities.",

        "patient": "At the time of diagnosis this patient was a 9 year-old female with a one year history of pain and swelling about her left knee. She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nAt the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing. Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed and assist in brachytherapy planning [Figure ]. The margins of the resection were involved with tumor, as demonstrated by field biopsies and assessment of the margins of resection. Satellite tumor nodules were present in the resection specimen. Four days after surgery the six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125 (Figure). The dwell time of the implant was 62 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2480 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Two weeks later the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy/day and received a course of treatment and total external beam dose of 5040 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered with two beams using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in March 2000.\nThe patient suffered moist desquamation corresponding to the radiation therapy portal that was predicted based on the treatment and the use of a tissue equivalent bolus material which was placed on the wound on alternating days during her course of external beam irradiation. She was able to return home on the last day of treatment. On routine follow-up, only 4 months after treatment, left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg by less than 1 cm. No corresponding gait problems were reported. Nearly one year after treatment (January 2000) physical examination showed good range of motion at the left knee; however, there was significant valgus angulation. An MR study was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and was noted to show growth arrest laterally and predominantly involving the distal femoral physis [Figure ]. Based on these findings, the family was informed that an epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis would likely be required to prevent additional deformity. Due to the angulatory deformity, an osteotomy of the distal femur would be required. Because of high-dose irradiation and concerns about bone healing, osteotomy and epiphysiodesis were deferred until the three year evaluation was performed. At that time, the patient had a significant valgus deformity. The morbidity of the deformity was such that ambulation was difficult. The patient underwent a closing wedge correcting osteotomy, which was fixed with a contour plate. The patient subsequently fractured the plate secondary to early and unprotected weightbearing (against medical advice). She was placed in a cast and ultimately healed her osteotomy. She continues to have a significant limb length discrepancy and will require future lengthening procedures. She remains without evidence of disease nearly 4 years after treatment.",

        "patient": "In September 2000, a 35-year-old female without any history or clinical stigmata of NF-1 presented to her primary physician with complaints of a dull, localized left upper leg pain of several months' duration. An abdominal mass was palpated during a physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large well-defined, near spherical mass in the left false pelvis which enhanced heterogeneously at a mean Hounsfield value of 44 units (Figure ). The mass displaced the external iliac vein medially and psoas muscle laterally. It also abutted the upper surface of the left ovary without truly invading any of these or other surrounding structures. However, the mass was believed to be in the course of the left genitofemoral nerve and lumbar plexus. The decision was made to resect the mass. Intraoperatively, the tumor's capsule was found to be densely adhered medially to the external iliac vessels, with at least 10 external venous branches directly supplying the tumor. The tumor was carefully marsupialized out of the retroperitoneal area and the decision was made to leave the residual capsule, since an attempt at its removal would have entailed a highly morbid procedure that was not felt to be justified based on the histopathologic appearance of the tumor on frozen sections. Intraoperatively, a pigmented macular lesion with faintly irregular edges was noted in the left upper thigh, which was biopsied. Pathologic examination showed a malignant melanoma with spitzoid features. The precise circumstances regarding the duration of the lesion and whether there had been any increase in its size was unclear. She subsequently underwent a wide local excision (4 \u00d7 12 cm skin ellipse was removed) and sentinel lymph node biopsy, both of which showed no residual melanoma. The patient's postoperative course over the subsequent 2 years was remarkable for a relatively slow but progressive improvements in the neurologic symptoms related to her surgery. However, she showed no evidence of either tumor recurrence at last follow-up, 26 months postoperatively.",

        "title": "Immunohistochemical investigations and introduction of new therapeutic strategies in scleromyxoedema: Case report",
        "patient": "We report a 44-year-old Caucasian woman who initially presented in 2003 with a multitude of progressive lichenoid 2\u20134 mm papules starting two years ago, particularly marked on the forehead right above both eyebrows, on the dorsal aspects of the forearms, shoulders, legs as well as on the gluteal region, accompanied by severe pruritus (Fig. ). Clinically, the papules were judged as discrete, circumscribed, erythematous to skin-coloured, firm skin eruptions associated with an induration and stiffening of the affected lesions. Furthermore, the patient complained about a progressive thickening of the glabella. Even though we cannot ensure continuous clinical deterioration, at the time of the initiation of therapy, there was no hint for a beginning stabilisation or even improvement of symptoms. Otherwise, she felt healthy and well. The general examination was without pathological findings. Neither a topical nor a systemic therapy was yet applied.\nSkin biopsies were taken from the left forearm/wrist, both legs and the left shoulder. Routine histological examination including haematoxylin-eosin, PAS labelling and Alcian blue staining revealed marked mucinous deposition within the upper and mid dermis beside an increased appearance of fibroblasts, collagen bundles and a discrete inflammatory infiltration.\nAdditionally, immunohistochemical investigations were performed in order to enumerate CD4+ (T helper cells), CD68+ (macrophages), anti-mastcell-tryptase+ (mastcells), decorin+ (collagen fibril stability protein), MIB-1+ (Ki-67+ proliferating cells), CD20+ (B lymphocytes), and FGF-R+ (fibroblast growth factor receptor bearing cells) cells taking consecutive sections (Table ). A punch skin biopsy measuring 3 mm in diameter was taken from affected skin of the right forearm. 5 \u03bcm paraffin-embedded sections were cut, mounted on slides and routinely preserved. Prior to the single immunolabelling, different pretreatments were performed for antigen retrieval (Table ). The alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique using the labelled streptavidin-biotin (LSAB) method was used to enumerate immunopositive cells at an individual dilution (Table ) taking consecutive sections. The alkaline phosphatase fast red detection kit utilised a biotinylated secondary antibody that binds to the primary antibody. This step was followed by the addition of an streptavidin enzyme conjugate binding to the biotin present on the secondary antibody. Afterwards the specific antibody-secondary-antibody-streptavidin-enzyme-complex was detected using a precipitating enzyme reaction product. Each step was incubated for a precise time and temperature. The alkaline phosphatase was used as enzyme; the chromogene fast red could be visualised. Cells were evaluated semiquantitatively (absent (-), rare (o), moderate (+), frequent (++)) directly below the dermoepidermal junction. Immunopositive cells were evaluated 'blind' separately in two view fields in a row (0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 mm each) directly below the dermoepidermal junction resulting in a length of 0.25 mm and 0.50 mm in depth. In order to avoid a sampling error, a number of sections were randomly reevaluated by a second observer. In case of a significant difference, the sections had to be recounted by both observers. In brief, immunolabelling revealed occasional perivascular CD4+ and CD20+ lymphocytes located in the papillary dermis and a high number of anti-mastcell-tryptase+ cells within the subepithelial perivascular infiltrate revealing a continuing decrease with increasing depth (Fig. ). Simultaneously, an increased dermal expression of MIB-1+ cells (Fig. ), morphologically predominantly fibroblasts, within the upper and mid dermis and sporadic FGF-R+ cells in an unspecific distribution could be detected. CD68 immunohistochemistry and intradermal decorin levels did not alter remarkably as compared to healthy controls (data not shown). Exact results of all immunohistochemical stainings are detailed in Table .\nComplete laboratory measurements unveiled the following pathological results: leucocytes 10870 \u03bcL-1, lymphocytes 13.2%, IgG 2000 mg/dl. There was no increase in B cell count. Immunoelectrophoresis disclosed albumin 51.4%, alpha-2 globuline 10.5%, gamma globuline 22.9%. Cranial x-ray, x-ray of the thorax, ultrasound of the abdominal organs, electrocardiography and urinary investigations were unremarkable. Blood smear cytological evaluation revealed beginning qualitative but still no quantitative changes as defined by leukocytic aberrations pointing towards a leftward shift. Serum immunofixation demonstrated an IgG-kappa paraproteinaemia. No elevation of the IgG-lambda paraprotein was assessed. Bone marrow biopsies displaying reactive lymphoid infiltration including minimal extension of plasma cells with monoclonal immunoglobuline production provided evidence for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) without distinct morphological characteristics of a plasmocytic plasmocytoma or plasmoblasts.\nInitially, 20 MHz ultrasound scanning producing cross section images of the skin was established in order to measure both structure and thickness of the skin at the dorsal aspects of the left wrist and the right forearm. The total thickness of the skin was measured from the entrance echo to the border between the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue. A cutaneous diameter of 2291 \u03bcm at the left wrist (lesional skin) and of 1106 \u03bcm at the right forearm (non-lesional skin) could be assessed.\nIn our unit, an experimental treatment modality using oral MTX 12.5 mg once per week followed by a subsequent folic acid application on the following day for a 6-months-period was subsequently initiated. MTX was well tolerated by our patient. After the first three months, the continuous progress of skin lesions during the last two years could be stopped and our patient experienced subjectively an improvement and objectively a stable clinical outcome without new lesions. Subjective impression of amelioration could not be confirmed by means of ultrasound measurement. Within the following two months, no further improvement could be evaluated, whereas no further progression such as formation of new lesions or increase of stiffness could be observed. Due to the unsatisfying clinical results and declining acceptance by our patient, MTX treatment was stopped and a subsequent therapeutic attempt with medium-dose UVA1 cold-light phototherapy was initiated. Irradiation consisting of 50 J/cm2 single-dose UVA1 (CL 300000 liquid, Photomed, Hamburg, Germany) was performed four times a week for three weeks followed by two times a week for further two weeks resulting in a cumulative dose of 800 J/cm2 after five weeks. Meanwhile, the skin status again remained stable, whereas no improvement could be observed. Therefore, our patient broke up phototherapy. To date, skin condition has slightly worsened without any current treatment modality.",

Neurological exam was exam was unremarkable.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed white cell count 17,400 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 15.1 gm/dl, sodium 128 mmol/l, potassium 4.1 mmol/l, chloride 91 mmol/l, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, glucose 273 mg/dl and an anion gap of 13. Urine analysis revealed red, cloudy urine with pH 5.0, nitrite positive and numerous white and red blood cells on microscopy. A pelvic X-ray (figure ) showed circumferential air in the bladder wall. CT scan of the pelvis (figure ) revealed gas in the bladder lumen and wall extending to the right ureter. He was empirically treated with gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam. He responded with defervescence and a decline in his white cell count. Urine cultures grew Escherichia coli and based on the sensitivities he was discharged home on ciprofloxacin.",

        "patient": "A 41-year-old lady presented with a short history of cardiac sounding chest pain. She was a smoker, had hypertension and had a strong family history of premature ischaemic heart disease. The ECG showed widespread anterior T wave inversion. Conventional treatment was started immediately for ACS including intravenous nitrates, low molecular weight heparin, aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient remained pain-free following admission and serial biochemistry demonstrated a rise in cardiac troponin I to 24 mmol/l at 24 hours. There was no evidence of Q waves on the ECG and left ventricular function was normal on echocardiography.\nCoronary angiography was undertaken four days after admission. This demonstrated mural thickening of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with a possible filling defect at the distal end of the lesion but no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis elsewhere (Fig. ). Interrogation of the proximal LAD stenosis with IVUS (Galaxy II system; Atlantis 40 MHz Catheter, Boston Scientific/Scimed, Inc., Maple Grove, Minnesota) showed a large intracoronary thrombus (Fig. ) adherent to a mural atheromatous plaque starting at the ostium of LAD (Fig. ). The thrombus had a lobulated appearance with no evidence of internal blood flow or speckling. It contained echolucent areas indicating cavitation and consistent with ongoing thrombus organization. No evidence of complete plaque rupture (intraplaque cavity communicating with the lumen) was seen.\nPercutaneous coronary intervention was performed using distal filter protection with the EZ Filterwire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). The GpIIb/IIIa antagonist Abciximab was administered. A 4.0 \u00d7 15 mm stent was placed directly with good final angiographic result (Fig. ) and no evidence of macroscopic distal embolisation. Repeat IVUS confirmed good apposition of the stent and the absence of residual thrombus (Fig. &). At retrieval, the Filterwire contained a small but significant amount of pink thrombotic material and yellowish plaque debris. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 380.\nNo further Troponin I elevation occurred; the patient was discharged home the next day, and remains asymptomatic at two months.",

        "patient": "A 43-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia since 1982, and a history of hospitalization to help the patient to acquire social communication abilities, at the age of 23 presented with slight pain on her left flank and back. In 1995, she was treated with ureterolysis and ureteroureterostomy because of left-sided ureteral obstruction. Histological evaluation of the biopsy revealed benign fibrous tissue proliferations; however, no further evaluation and surgical excision was planned as her mental state was deteriorating. She was put on regular follow-up with computed tomography (CT) scans. In May 2002, she was referred from the psychiatric hospital to our Department of Urology, as the tumor tended to grow. CT scan with contrast enhancement revealed a tumor located between iliocostalis and psoas muscles in retroperitoneal space. The peripheral part of the tumor was enhanced, while the central part did not. The left paravertebral muscles around the tumor showed atrophy. The medial margin of the tumor was deformed by a left transverse process of the second lumber spine, suggesting invasive behavior (Figure ). Coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the tumor to be located beneath the left kidney. The central part of the tumor was found to be of iso/low intensity in the T1-weighted phase and of heterogeneously high intensity in the T2-weighted phase. The marginal part showed very low intensity in both phases (Figure ). In May 2002, needle biopsy was performed and revealed that the tumor consisted of well-proliferated spindle cells rich in collagen fibers, an observation that was inconsistent with the histological pictures made in 1995. In June 2002, resection was performed using a paraspinal approach. Although the tumor strongly adhered to adjacent tissues, including the urinary tract and peritoneum, it was marginally resected, including paravertebral muscles and part of the spine. As the kidney was less affected by the tumor, ablation posed no problem. On gross examination, the cut surface appeared homogeneously gray and glossy (Figure ). Histologically, a uniform proliferation of spindle cells with a moderate amount of collagen fibers led to a diagnosis of extraabdominal fibromatosis in the retroperitoneal space (Figure ). No adjuvant treatment was given and during the two years of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic, with no restrictions of daily living. There were no clues as to recurrence of the tumor in computed tomography.",

        "title": "Cerebral relapse of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor during treatment with imatinib mesylate: Case report",
        "patient": "A 47-year-old man presented in July 1999 with melena. A small bowel series and CT abdomen showed a jejunal mass and a 5 \u00d7 5 cm complex hepatic mass. A biopsy of the liver lesion revealed a spindle cell tumor. Laparotomy was performed, and the 7.5 cm jejunal mass was resected. A total of 4 liver lesions were noted, but not resected. The histopathology confirmed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with clear resection margins. He subsequently had 4 cycles of attempted cytoreductive chemotherapy using doxorubicin and dacarbazine. A repeat CT scan showed progression of the liver metastases. An extended right hemihepatectomy was performed in December 1999 with successful excision of all 4 liver metastases.\nThe patient remained well until review in August 2001 when he complained of lethargy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, diplopia and blurred vision in the left eye. Examination revealed weakness of the right lateral rectus ocular muscle, an amelanotic left choroidal lesion, hepatomegaly and a subcutaneous nodule in the gluteal region. An enhancing lesion in the infero-lateral region of the right globe was confirmed on CT which was thought to be the cause of the ocular muscle weakness. The CT scan also demonstrated a recurrence of multiple hepatic metastases. There were no intracerebral lesions. The gluteal lesion was biopsied and confirmed recurrence of GIST (CD117 positive). A positron emission tomogram (PET) scan also confirmed disease recurrence in the same distribution. Lumbar puncture and MRI scan of the brain excluded the presence of leptomeningeal or cerebral metastases. The patient was commenced on imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec, Novartis) 400 mg bd in September 2001 as part of a clinical trial. He felt much improved by November 2001 when a repeat CT abdomen showed stable disease but PET scan now showed no FDG uptake. By January 2002 his diplopia had completely resolved but the left-sided choroidal lesion remained unchanged on fundoscopy. The buttock lesion had also resolved.\nA progress CT in December 2002 showed minor enlargement of one of the liver lesions. A PET scan however continued to show no areas of abnormal FDG uptake. The patient at that time had developed a right-sided foot drop. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated a left parasagittal tumor with radiographic features consistent with a meningioma (see Figure ). Imatinib was ceased preoperatively as per the trial protocol. A craniotomy was performed on the 28th January 2003 with complete resection of the lesion. Histopathology demonstrated metastatic GIST (CD117 positive) (see Figures and ). Post operatively the patient developed recurrent diplopia (due to recurrent right lateral rectus weakness) with blurred vision off imatinib. This was recommenced at a dose of 400 mg bd on the 14th February 2003 after being ceased 6 weeks earlier because of the documented disease progression in the brain as required by the trial protocol. Drug supply was obtained through a compassionate use program. Repeat fundoscopy in February 2003 showed the choroidal lesion had enlarged. His foot drop persisted, however his diplopia again had completely resolved by March 2003.\nMutational analysis on the tumor blocks was carried out. An in-frame GCCTAT insertion/duplication in exon 9 of c-kit in the original jejunal tumor, the liver and the cerebral metastases were detected (See Figure ). No mutations were found in exons 11, 13 or 17 in any of the samples.\nDue to limited drug supply available on compassionate use (pending local approval for reimbursement), the patient's dose of imatinib mesylate was reduced to 400 mg per day in March 2003. Six weeks later, his diplopia had returned and a progress CT abdomen demonstrated a minor progression of the liver lesions. His liver function tests remained normal. A subsequent PET scan again showed no abnormal uptake despite disease progression on the CT scan. His dose of imatinib mesylate was increased initially to 600 mg per day with resolution of the diplopia.\nBy May 2003 his foot drop had worsened and his dose of imatinib mesylate was increased back to 800 mg per day. Despite the increase in dose, his foot drop worsened. A repeat CT brain demonstrated a recurrence of the cerebral metastasis with surrounding vasogenic oedema in the previous site of resection. A repeat abdominal CT showed no significant change in the size of the liver metastasis and mild shrinking of the nodule in the buttock.\nDue to limited treatment options available for the cerebral metastasis, a re-resection of the cranial metastasis was offered. A repeat MRI of the brain in late July 2003 confirmed the presence of the left parasagittal lesion with surrounding edema but no mass effect. Repeat craniotomy and incomplete debulking of the parasagittal metastasis was performed on the 9th September 2003. A small residual area of tumor was seen on the postoperative scan. Abdominal imaging two months later showed that two of the liver lesions had increased in size with the other areas stable. He was not a candidate for further hepatic resection as there was insufficient liver reserve due to the past surgery. Radiofrequency ablation was declined as the patient did not have symptoms referable to the area.\nThe patient remained well until December 2003 when he experienced symptoms of headaches, worsening diplopia, right foot drop and left arm weakness. MRI scan confirmed recurrence of the cerebral metastasis with extension across the falx cerebri. He declined cranial radiotherapy treatment at the time and instead underwent a third resection of the lesion in January 2004 where incomplete debulking was achieved with early improvement of his limb weakness. In April 2004 the patient enrolled into a randomised placebo controlled clinical trial of a novel multi-kinase inhibitor SU-11248 (Pfizer) for the treatment of imatinib refractory GIST. However his condition slowly deteriorated and he died in July 2004.",

        "title": "Effect of splenectomy on type-1/type-2 cytokine gene expression in a patient with adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)",
        "patient": "A 42 year old woman presented in October 1999 in Patras University Hospital (PUH) with lower limb purpura and low platelet count (7 \u00d7 106/L). Following clinical exclusion of causes of secondary thrombocytopenia [] the diagnosis of ITP was reached.\nThe patient initially received glucocorticoid treatment to which she showed a temporary response until 6 months later when she relapsed. She was subsequently started on danazol without any clinical benefit. Intravenous immune globulin administration also proved ineffective after two 5-day cycles. As a result, the patient was subjected to splenectomy 9 months after the diagnosis with complete response, attaining platelet counts over 150 \u00d7 106/L within 10 days after the operation. Five years later, she remains in clinical remission.\nTwo consecutive blood samples were obtained from the patient, 3 and 7 months after splenectomy for the purposes of this study. A control group consisted of 11 adult healthy volunteers (6 women and 5 men, median age 40 years, range 18\u201365 years). Informed consent was obtained from the patient. PUH abides by the Helsinki declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from each blood sample by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia, Sweden). The cells were cultured in vitro for 8 h with the addition of 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 \u03bcM ionomycin (Sigma, St-Louis, MI).\nTotal cellular RNA extracted from 106 cells was submitted to semiquantitative RT-PCR for the amplification of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 metagraphs []. Primers and conditions for the RT-PCR are summarized in Table . The PCR products were run on ethidium-stained agarose gels, photographed and quantified [].\nA sharp decrease in the expression of the type-1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and their calculated sum expressing Th1 activity was observed at 7 months after splenectomy compared to 3 months after splenectomy (Figure ); this was accompanied by a parallel rise of platelet count from 190 \u00d7 106/L to 265 \u00d7 106/L. Regarding type-2 cytokine gene expression, IL-4 increased, IL-5 decreased, and IL-10 remained unchanged, whereas the change in Th2 activity (IL-4 units plus IL-5 units) was slight (Figure ). The Th1/Th2 ratio {(IL-2+IFN\u03b3)/(IL-4+IL-5)}, that reflects immune deviation, was accordingly greatly reduced 7 months post-splenectomy (Th1/Th2 = 1.3) compared to 3 months (Th1/Th2 = 3.5) (Figure ). Mean Th1/Th2 ratio of the controls was 0.5 with 95% confidence intervals of the mean (0.15\u20130.85). The Th1/Th2 values at 3 months and at 7 months post-splenectomy lie at 6.25 and 1.6 standard deviations above the mean of the controls, respectively.\nThe above results show that in this patient type-1 polarization persists after removal of the spleen and attainment of clinical remission. This may mean that the spleen is not exclusively responsible for the coordination or the maintenance of the pathological immune response in this patient, provided that no accessory splenic tissue exists. Other disease centres may control the autoimmune reaction as well, such as the liver or the bone marrow. Alternatively, it is possible that ITP is the manifestation of a general immune system malfunction that pre-existed before the development of thrombocytopenia and persists after removal of what seems to be the effector of a manifestation of an autoimmune proclivity.\nUnfortunately, a pre-splenectomy sample was not available for analysis. As a result, no conclusions can be drawn about the effect of splenectomy on the direction of change of Th1 activity. Based on phenotypic studies showing increased presence of T lymphocytes with activated phenotype after splenectomy in ITP patients [], it is plausible that peripheral Th1 activity may have increased after splenectomy.\nThe clinical remission may be due to the removal of a major platelet destruction site, although the underlying immune activity that drives the destruction may remain unaffected. Complete remission does not mean that increased platelet destruction has stopped after splenectomy. Platelet life span may still be shortened in this patient and/or her normal platelet count may be even higher than what was achieved after splenectomy.\nThe pathological immune activity seems to decrease over time after splenectomy, as reflected by the lower Th1/Th2 ratio that is indicative of the degree of immune polarization. This may be explained by reduced stimulation of the immune system by activated spleen reticuloendothelial cells that present platelet antigens to T helper lymphocytes. In this way, it may be hypothesized that removal of one vital component of the self-attacking immune process can break the vicious circle that culminates in even greater immune activation, polarization, and platelet destruction. Removal of a major site of autoimmune activity may have abrogated recruitment of na\u00efve T-cells. As a result, overall autoimmune activity wears off, as existing activated Th1 effector cells perish leaving behind a much smaller population of peripheral memory cells that retain the initial Th phenotype.\nAnother consideration that stems from the results of this case study is that immune polarization and immune deviation of the pathological response depend more on upregulation of type-1 mediators rather than on suppression of type-2 cytokines, or that type-2 response is inadequate to control excess type-1 response in active disease.",

        "title": "An unusual case of chronic meningitis",
        "patient": "A 62-year-old retired woman was admitted to hospital via her GP for investigation of a four-week history of vomiting and malaise associated with hyponatraemia. She was initially diagnosed as suffering from viral gastroenteritis. However, the vomiting had persisted and had become associated with a mild frontal headache. She had an unremarkable past medical history and was not taking any regular medication. She had never smoked and there was no recent antecedent foreign travel.\nOn examination she appeared clinically dehydrated but otherwise looked well, and was alert and orientated. She was apyrexial and had no rash, photophobia, neck stiffness or stigmata of endocarditis. She had a sinus tachycardia of 104/minute, with normal heart sounds, and a blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg. Chest, abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable. She had a plasma sodium of 127 mmol/L (135\u2013145 mmol/L), potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.0 mmol/l), urea 4.8 mmol/L (3.0\u20136.5 mmol/L) and creatinine of 68 mmol/L (60\u2013125 mmol/L). There was no biochemical evidence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) production (serum osmolality 261 mmols/kg; urine osmolality 71 mmols/Kg; urine sodium < 10 mmol/L). Serum complement and plasma immunoglobulin levels were unremarkable with no evidence of immunosuppression. In addition, she had a normal full autoimmune profile and thyroid function. Random cortisol level was mildly elevated at 799 nmol/L (normal 140 \u2013 700 nmol/L) consistent with a stress response.\nHer initial white cell count (WCC) was mildly elevated at 13.0 \u00d7 109/L (normal 4\u201311 \u00d7 109/L) with a neutrophilia of 10 \u00d7 109/L (normal 2\u20137.5 \u00d7 109/L). Her ECG and chest X-ray were normal. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 10 mg/L (normal <5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal at 5 mm/hour. Her Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Initial microbiological investigations (blood cultures, urine microscopy and culture) were normal.\nInitial management consisted of slow intravenous rehydration with normal saline and antiemetic therapy, which led to a mild symptomatic improvement. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mild oesophagitis.\nDuring the ensuing two weeks her laboratory investigations remained stable (CRP normal; ESR normal; sodium 127\u2013131 mmol/L; WCC 11\u201313 \u00d7 109/L). However, on day 4 of admission she developed a low-grade pyrexia of 37.5\u00b0C, which persisted (<38\u00b0C). A CT scan of the head revealed periventricular patchy white matter changes but no features of raised intracranial pressure or space occupying lesion.\nUnfortunately the patient had become slowly more lethargic, withdrawn, and depressed. By day 17 of admission, although alert, she was uncooperative with intermittent confusion. Her symptoms of intermittent nausea and vomiting with occasional frontal headache continued.\nOn day 18 she underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) as she still had a low-grade pyrexia (temperature 37.5\u00b0C) and neutrophilia of 9.3 \u00d7 109/L). In addition, her nausea and vomiting had failed to fully settle with supportive treatment. The LP results were as follows: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appearance was pale yellow and clear; protein = 5.69 g/L (0.15\u20130.4 g/L); CSF glucose 1.7 mmol/L versus plasma glucose 5.7 mmol/L (ratio = 30%, normal > 50%); CSF WCC = 106/mL (normal <5 WCC/mL) \u2013 99% lymphocytes. Gram's stain revealed gram-negative coccobacilli; acid-fast bacilli were not seen. She was commenced on intravenous ceftriaxone.\nContrast MRI brain revealed sub-acute infarction of the right frontal cortex but with no evidence of meningeal enhancement. EEG demonstrated slow wave activity, which was consistent with a meningo-encephalitis.\nWithin 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics she was more alert, orientated, and sitting out of bed. CSF culture grew gram-negative cocci, which was identified as Neisseria meningitidis group B, type NT, subtype NT P1.16/nt. She underwent contact tracing and completed a 10-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone. She continued to make a slow but progressive recovery. After a period of rehabilitation and intense physiotherapy she was discharged home 40 days after admission, with mild residual gait ataxia.",

        "title": "Intracardiac echocardiography to guide transseptal catheterization for radiofrequency catheter ablation of left-sided accessory pathways: two case reports",
        "patient": "A 24 year-old woman with Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and recurrent episodes of sustained supraventricular tachycardia, refractory to medical therapy, was referred to our Department in order to attempt TCRFA procedure. The electrophysiological study was performed off therapy using three diagnostic catheters (one decapolar and two quadripolars) which have been positioned in the coronary sinus (CS1 \u2192 CS5 = distal \u2192 proximal coronary sinus), His bundle region, and high right atrium/right ventricular apex. The clinical arrhythmia was diagnosed as an orthodromic atrio-ventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to a LSAP that was repetitively induced by both right atrial and ventricular programmed electrical stimulation. The length of the tachycardia cycle ranged from 310 to 300 msec. A well-localized accessory pathway insertion was detected in the lateral left free wall with atrial-ventricular (AV) and ventricular-atrial (VA) intervals of fusion noticeable only in CS2 (Fig ). During programmed atrial stimulation and AVRT, the transaortic approach was initially attempted by using a 7F-4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific). Although very short VA and AV intervals (<50 msec without isoelectric line between the two potentials) and satisfactory mean temperature (54\u201356 C\u00b0 for 20\u201330 sec with less than 30 Watts for each radiofrequency application) were obtained, repeated radiofrequency erogations resulted in a transient interruption of the anomalous connection, with recurrence of retrograde conduction along the accessory pathway and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia inducibility after a period of 20\u201330 min. Therefore, by using a mechanical single element ultrasound 9F-9 MHz catheter, an ICE-guided transseptal approach was attempted in order to cranially map the mitral ring (Ultra ICE Boston Scientific/CVIS San Jos\u00e9, CA USA). This approach has provided a 360\u00b0 two-dimensional imaging on a transverse plane perpendicular to the transducer with a radial field of view of approximately 5 cm in depth. ICE catheter was introduced via femoral vein through a 10F long sheath and advanced into the high right atrium. Careful handling of the catheter, along the interatrial septum, provided optimal view of the fossa ovalis that could be easily recognized as a thin area compared to the surrounding atrial structures. The standard approach to transseptal catheterization using a long sheath and dilator over a Brockenbrough needle, was used []. The tip of the needle-dilator-sheath apparatus was positioned facing the middle portion of the fossa ovalis. Careful up and down movements of ICE catheter allowed a clear visualization of the needle as well as its contact with the septal wall causing the typical \"tenting\" effect (Fig ), which allowed precise location of the puncture of the needle.\nAccessory pathway was completely and definitively ablated with this approach after two erogations lasting each 40 sec. Although the AV and VA intervals that had been selected to deliver radiofrequency energy were similar to those previously recorded, the only difference was a better AV ratio (Fig ). Such findings might be related to the cranial approach of the atrioventricular ring which has allowed a more stable catheter position on endocardium surface and a lack of lateral sliding, resulting in a higher mean temperature (60\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 vs 54\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0). Radiation exposure was shorter with the transseptal approach (11 vs 19 min) when compared to the retrograde approach.",

The accessory pathway insertion resulted well-localized in the left lateral mitral ring during AVRT and atrial pacing with maximal pre-excitation (Fig ). The trans-aortic approach was firstly attempted by using a 7F- 4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific). Despite an optimal catheter tip temperature for a reasonable period of time (five erogations reaching a mean temperature of 55\u00b0 lasting 30\u201340 sec), only a temporary interruption of the anomalous pathway conduction was obtained. Therefore, ICE-guided transseptal approach was performed as previously described (see ). The approach resulted in a persistent and complete ablation of the accessory pathway after two successful radiofrequency erogations which have been delivered when the VA interval resulted fused and its ratio was 1,5:1. In this case, ICE allowed a more complete mapping of the mitral ring and a confirmation of effective catheter ablation tip contact. As in the previously described case, the superior approach to the left AV ring resulted in a better manipulation of the ablation catheter in addition to a reduction in fluoroscopic time (10 vs 21 min).",

        "title": "An unusual case of an ulcerative colitis flare resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and a bladder hematoma: a case report",
        "patient": "A 14-year-old boy with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis based on colonic histology, serology and a normal barium study of his small bowels was admitted with a five-day history of nonbilious vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Additional symptoms included recent onset hematuria, and low-grade fevers to 100.4 C over the prior four days. He had also sustained a 25 lb weight loss in the last six months, indicating a lack of disease control.\nAs an outpatient, his maintenance therapy included mesalamine (1 gram three times a day), and mercaptopurine (75 mg once per day). In addition, he had been started on prednisone approximately 7 weeks prior for treatment of an ulcerative colitis flare. His current dose of prednisone was 10 mg once a day. Soon after symptoms begun, he had been placed on ciprofloxacin as treatment for a presumptive flare.\nPhysical exam showed he was afebrile, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, respiratory 16 breaths per minute and blood pressure 115/67 mmHg. He was alert although with a sallow appearance. Abdominal exam revealed a soft nontender nondistended abdomen. Rectal showed normal external exam with grossly bloody stool. Initial blood work showed hemoglobin of 12.3, a normal white blood cell count, normal differential and normal platelet count with a mildly elevated prothrombin time of 16.2 with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. Urine analysis showed a specific gravity of 1.035, 3+blood, +ketones and > 100 RBC per high powered field and 0\u20135 WBC per high power field. Abdominal ultrasound revealed irregular shaped bladder wall.\nPatient was placed on intravenous fluids (IV) as well as metronidazole (IV). Blood and urine cultures were sent for analysis. Stool was sent for culture and for Clostridium difficile toxin analysis.\nSerial repeat lab works the following day revealed a dropping hemoglobin (7.4 g/dL) and platelet count (64 K/mm3) increasing PT/PTT (21.3/47 seconds) with an INR of 1.8. Blood smear showed moderate amount of elliptocytes, schistocytes, microcytes and fragmented red blood cells. Initial DIC panel revealed an elevated D-dimer of 4.9 mcg/mL with a normal thrombin time and fibrinogen. Thrombin time subsequently increased to > 120 seconds. D-dimers increased to 10.3 mcg/mL. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a marked thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall as well as wall thickening of the rectosigmoid, ascending, transverse, and descending colon (Figure ). Urology was consulted and felt that this represented a submucosal hematoma.\nPatient was begun on broad-spectrum antibiotics because of concerns regarding possible bacteremia and a worsening DIC laboratory picture. Blood, stool and urine cultures returned negative. Viral cultures and monoclonal antibody staining for adenovirus detection in the urine was negative. Despite a worsening in the DIC panel, the patient remained clinically unchanged. IV steroids were begun approximately 36 hours into patient's hospital stay. Patient had a stabilization of PT/PTT/INR/thrombin time and D-dimer, and a subsequent normalization of labs over the following 4-day period ( Figure , , , , , , ). Patient's diarrhea and hematuria resolved as well. Colonscopy revealed chronic colitis consistent with ulcerative colitis. Cystoscopy revealed a fibrin clot consistent with submucosal hematoma. Patient was discharged from the hospital on a steroid taper, and remains in remission to date.",

        "title": "First successful case of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer with venom immunotherapy for hymenoptera sting allergy",
        "patient": "A 39 year-old Caucasian G4P1031 was referred for evaluation and management of recurrent pregnancy loss. Medical history was significant for known carrier state for \u03b2-thalassemia. Mild hypothyroidism had been diagnosed in 2002 with immediate initiation of replacement therapy. The patient was a non-smoker, in good general health and had no gynecologic complaint. BMI was 21.7 kg/m2. In 1997, she experienced a severe hypotensive anaphylactic reaction following a yellow jacket sting (Vespula spp.) resulting in a full allergy work-up. The patient began subcutaneous injection of 100 mcg mixed vespid hymenoptera venom/venom protein (Pharmalgen\u00ae; ALK Abello, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark) every 5\u20136 weeks, which was well tolerated.\nAll four conceptions were established without medical assistance, involved the same partner, and were achieved after the hymenoptera hypersensitivity diagnosis. The initial pregnancy occurred three years before presentation and resulted in a first trimester spontaneous abortion. No adjustment was made to the allergy injection regimen during that pregnancy. Fetal cardiac activity was initially present, but was lost at 10 weeks' gestation for unknown reasons. No curettage was performed.\nOne year later, a second pregnancy was established but for this pregnancy hymenoptera venom therapy was discontinued when pregnancy was first recognized (~6 weeks). A 3170 g female infant was delivered vaginally at 40 1/2 weeks' gestation. In 2001 and 2002, the patient established two additional pregnancies and hymenoptera therapy was maintained at 5\u20136 week intervals for both; both resulted in first trimester spontaneous abortions. For these miscarriages, dilation and curettage was undertaken but no karyotype was performed and no cause for the losses was identified.\nAt our institution, euthyroid status was verified, the thalassemia carrier state was confirmed, and we identified a new homozygous A223V mutation at the methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) locus. Folic acid intake was immediately increased to 800 mcg/d, although a baseline serum homocysteine level was not measured. Factor V Leiden, protein S, protein C, and other coagulation tests were normal, as were karyotypes obtained from both partners. Anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid and antiovarian antibody titres were all negative. However, transvaginal saline uterine sonography revealed a uniform 5 mm echodense lesion consistent with an endometrial polyp. Outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy was performed without complication. After discussing various infertility therapies and associated success rates given her age, the patient elected to undergo IVF.\nIn March 2003, the patient began programmed ovarian hyperstimulation using a combined recombinant-FSH+hMG protocol (300 IU/d Humegon\u00ae, Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Tarrytown, NY USA and 300 IU/d Gonal-F\u00ae, Serono Labs; Norwell, MA USA). Pre-treatment pituitary downregulation was achieved via 5 u/d leuprolide acetate and was continued \u00d7 3 d after gonadotropin therapy commenced. No alteration was made in the patient's allergy injection sequence during ovulation induction (i.e., 100 mcg every 5\u20136 weeks), and serum yellow jacket RAST IgE measurements were obtained via commercial fluoroimmunoassay including positive and negative controls (UniCAP\u00ae IgE kit, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). While absolute IgE levels remained <0.35 kU/l throughout therapy, percentage IgE results were variable and these data are summarized in Figure .\nOn cycle day 10, subcutaneous hCG (10,000 IU) was given [] with serum estradiol at 1090 pg/ml. Twelve oocytes were retrieved and 7 advanced to the 2pn stage following conventional insemination. A four-day course of methylprednisolone (16 mg/d) was started on the day of oocyte retrieval. On post-fertilization day three, the ultrasound-guided transfer of four embryos was performed. Immediately following embryo transfer, the patient was placed on oral aspirin (81 mg/d) and subcutaneous heparin (5,000 IU b.i.d). Luteal phase support was administered as daily 50 mg IM progsterone in oil injections.\nTwo weeks after embryo transfer, serum hCG was 72 mIU/ml. On May 5, 2003, transvaginal ultrasound confirmed a single intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac rate at 126/min. Progesterone was discontinued at the 10th gestational week. Immunology and perinatology consultants agreed with reduced dose allergy protocol through the third trimester, and hymenoptera venom protein extract (75 mcg) treatment was maintained to 32 weeks gestation. The patient experienced no untoward reaction or hypersensitivity to gonadotropins, VIT, or supplementary progesterone during therapy.\nAt 32 weeks, obstetrical sonogram suggested reduced amniotic fluid levels and the patient was given intramuscular betamethasone (12 mg/d \u00d7 2 days) and placed on bedrest. At this point allergy injections were discontinued since the patient was not outdoors and risk for insect sting was regarded as low. Intravenous oxytocin was started at 35 weeks due to oligohydramnios and resulted in vaginal delivery of a 2495 g female infant. Mother and baby were discharged home after an uncomplicated two-day postpartum course. Allergy injections resumed (100 mcg every 5\u20136 weeks) when breastfeeding was completed three months later.",

        "title": "Traumatic deep vein thrombosis in a soccer player: A case study",
        "patient": "A 42 year old Polish born male former semi-professional soccer player was seen on May 16th, 2003 in the emergency department, with the chief complaint of right leg pain. The patient had been playing soccer 10 days prior to this visit, and recalled a traumatic \"tackle\" injury to the posterior area of his right lower extremity. He denied experiencing any sensation of tearing or popping in the right knee during the index trauma, and was able to complete the game with only minor discomfort. On day 3 post-injury the patient noted severe pain in his knee and calf with ambulation. The patient visited his primary doctor on post-injury day 8 and was diagnosed with a right lower extremity soft tissue injury. A right lower extremity echo-doppler ultrasound (US), and a semi-quantitative D-dimer automated latex procedure were ordered to rule out a vascular disorder. The US investigation demonstrated a DVT in the distal femoral, popliteal, and distal calf veins, with a heterogenous mass (5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm, resembling a hematoma) without a doppler signal in the right popliteal fossa. The D-dimer result was also positive for a suspected thrombosis (1.0\u20132.0 ug/ml; range = <0.25 ug/ml). The patient was instructed by his physician to proceed immediately to the emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.\nThe past medical and family history of the patient was non-contributory for a history of thrombophilia or other thrombotic major risk factors. The patient had a remote (11 years old) surgical history of a right-sided inguinal hernia that could have created scar tissue contributing to vascular obstruction and stasis. The initial emergency department examination demonstrated an exquisitely tender right calf with a 3 cm difference in mid-calf girth (10 cm. distal from each inferior patellar pole); a 1+ right knee supra patellar effusion; and a palpable popliteal mass with visible ecchymosis. Laboratory tests (CBC, Lytes, PT, PTT, ESR, CPK, Anti-throbomin, Factor V Leiden, Lupus Screen, ANA, Anti-Cardiolipin, Protein C, and Protein S) were negative for metabolic, hematological or familial abnormalities. A repeat US investigation confirmed the results of the previous outpatient results. The patient was anticoagulated simultaneously with unfractionated heparin and Warfarin sulfate. A multiview plain film x-ray examination of the right lower extremity demonstrated no fracture, dislocation, or bony mass.\nA magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right knee was done several days after admission, to verify a torn right knee meniscal cartilage that had been previously diagnosed. The official MRI radiological report included a small free-edge tear of the posterior horn root junction of the lateral meniscus, chondromalasia (lateral patella and lateral femoral articular cartilage), and a moderate joint effusion with a bursal cyst or dilated semimembranous-gastronemius bursa.\nAnticoagulation was achieved on day 6 of the patient's hospitalization. He was discharged on 5 mg of warfarin per day, with instructions to continue the use of compression stockings. The patient was also advised to follow up with his primary physician for regular monitoring, and to avoid contact or collision activities during anticoagulation.\nThe patient was maintained on warfarin for six months, with weekly physician monitoring (symptoms, PT, INR) for the first three months post-injury. The monitoring interval was changed to once per month for the remainder of the treatment period. Hematologic investigations (APTT, PT, INR, Cardiolipin antibody, C-reactive protein, Lupant anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, Antithrombin, ANA, Protein C, Protein S, and RPR) were obtained three months post injury. There were no contributory thrombophilic factors found in these investigations. Laboratory levels of Protein C activity 22% (range = 70\u2013140%), Protein S activity 48% (range = 75\u2013140%), INR 2.57 (range = 0.88\u20131.12), and PT 27.5 sec (range = 9.6\u201312.0 sec); APTT 38.5 sec (range = 23.4\u201335.4 sec) were found to be appropriately reactive to the anticoagulant therapy.\nThe patient underwent two arthrocentesis procedures to remove small amounts of serous fluid from the joint, and each time was injected with a lidocaine/corticosteroid combination. US examinations after the hospitalization period failed to demonstrate a recurrence or new onset of DVT, however residual echogenic material characteristic of a chronic thrombus was demonstrated in the popliteal vein. Compression stocking use was maintained after hospital discharge, and was discontinued after nine months. The patient returned to soccer after anticoagulation, with a full understanding of his increased risk of DVT recurrence.\nOne-year post injury the patient continued to suffer from intermittent right lower extremity discomfort and swelling often unrelated to activity. An elective arthroscopy was recently performed on the patient's right knee to investigate his long-standing meniscal disruption and effusion. The arthroscopy demonstrated several areas of arthrosis (patellar lateral and medial facets, lateral and medial femoral condyles), and a torn lateral meniscus. Appropriate partial lateral menisectomy and debridement, and chondroplasty of the areas of arthrosis were preformed. An arthroscopic examination of the posterior compartment demonstrated a small cleft-like area just medial to the semimembranosis where the Baker's cyst likely originated. The patient returned to the orthopedist one week post-op with a large (150 cc's) hemarthrosis that was aspirated from the knee. He was requested to follow-up in one month for re-evaluation.",

        "title": "Increased deep sleep in a medication-free, detoxified female offender with schizophrenia, alcoholism and a history of attempted homicide: Case report",
        "patient": "The patient was a 23-year-old woman charged with attempted manslaughter. She was ordered by the court to undergo a pre-trial forensic psychiatric examination which took place in a maximum security state mental hospital. The trial records and all available background information were reviewed. Both of her parents were alcoholics and she was taken to protective custody under the age of one year. Her grandmother suffered from schizophrenia and her mother had been in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. The patient used to shoplift before the age of 15 and later she stole money from time to time. She also worked as a prostitute to earn money. She started to abuse alcohol at the age of 15. She had several boyfriends but has never married and has no children. Her personality was noticed to change before the age of 17. She started to have obsessive-compulsive behaviour, paranoid thoughts as well as depressive symptoms. She tried to kill herself by hanging and by several drug intoxications. She brutally killed her own pet. She was never hospitalized before the forensic mental examination but she irregularly visited an outpatient clinic. Despite psychiatric treatment, she impulsively tried to kill her male friend with whom she was drinking. During the psychiatric examination the diagnoses \u2013 schizophrenia paranoid type, alcohol dependence and features of antisocial personality disorder \u2013 were made by a senior forensic psychiatrist using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, SCID I and II [,]. Neither waking EEG nor brain MRI (1.5T) disclosed any abnormality. She had no somatic disorders. She had finished high school and vocational school, and was within average intelligence (WAIS-IQ total 109). She was not sentenced, but was ordered by the Finnish National Board of Medico-Legal Affairs to stay in the state mental hospital as a criminally insane patient. The sleep recordings were performed during the psychiatric examination period and the patient was completely medication-free and had abstained from alcohol and drugs for six months.\nThe control group consisted of three 23-year-old female students without criminal records or a history of physical violence. They were healthy with no signs of somatic, psychiatric, or neurological disorders. As part of a psychiatric interview, the SCID-non-patient version [] was filled in. To exclude general diseases that could affect sleep, blood tests (including serum prolactin, thyroid function, kidney and liver function) and electrocardiograms were taken and they were within normal range, both in the patient and in controls. No history of alcohol abuse or dependence was detected in controls. The controls were asked to avoid alcohol, drugs or medication two weeks prior to the sleep examinations. Caffeine and nicotine consumption was neither restricted nor recorded.\nWritten consent was obtained from all participants after the study procedure had been fully explained to them. The study was approved by the local human ethics committee.\nPolysomnography (PSG) was recorded over two consecutive nights but only the second night was considered for the study. The study patient slept in a single room within the department, while controls slept in the hospital guest room. All participants were allowed to sleep as long as they wanted to. Recordings took place on an ambulatory basis; the participant had a portable recording device (Embla, Flaga hf, Reykjavik, Iceland) that was connected to the recording electrodes. The recordings were performed using the standard Rechtschaffen-Kales method []. The high-pass filter was 0.5 Hz and the low-pass filter 45 Hz, with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. Commercial software (Somnologica, version 2.0, Flaga hf, Reykjavik, Iceland) was used for scoring and calculation of sleep parameters. Sleep onset was defined as the first occurrence of three consecutive epochs (90 sec) of stage 1 (S1) or other sleep stages. The following parameters were calculated: time in bed, sleep latency, sleep period (time in bed \u2013 sleep latency), wake after sleep onset, total sleep time (sleep period \u2013 wake after sleep onset), sleep efficiency (total sleep time/sleep period), number of awakenings, REM latency and percentage amounts of different sleep stages (S1\u2013S4 %, REM %). All data for the analysis were scored by the same scorer (NL), not blinded to the patient group.\nA sleep diary was used for one week during the study period to ensure a normal sleep-wake rhythm and to exclude the effects of daytime naps. The participant filled in the time of retiring to bed, estimated time of falling asleep and time of awakening in the morning for each consecutive night as well as daytime naps.",

        "patient": "A 29 year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 2-year history of paroxysmal attacks of dyspnea, dry cough and wheezing. He had smoked 2 packs/day cigarettes for 3 years and has been ex-smoker for 5 years. He experienced frequent sudden-onset coughing episodes followed by the development of dyspnea and wheezing a year ago. He was previously diagnosed with difficult asthma and treated with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (1600 \u03bcg budesonide) and bronchodilators. Since he was unresponsive to the therapy, he has applied to several institutions for multiple times to seek medical attention.\nOn admission, no stridor, wheezing and cyanosis were present and the general appearance was good. Vital signs were as follows: temperature 37\u00b0C, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse 96 beats/min, blood pressure 140/70 mmHg. The chest examination was unremarkable. The results of the routine laboratory analysis, including complete blood cell count, chemistry, arterial blood gas, urinalysis and chest x-ray were within normal ranges. On spirometric examination, flow-volume curve displayed suggestive fixed airway obstruction. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was 122 % of predicted, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 31 % of predicted and FEV1/FVC was 21 % (Figure ). In order to exclude the possibility of upper airway obstruction, a work-up of computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was obtained. The CT scan illustrated a solid, polipoid intratracheal mass originating from the right side of the trachea at 4 centimeter proximal of the carina (Figure ). FOB revealed a smooth, round mass of 2 cm in diameter originating from the right lateral side of the trachea. The lesion was occupying approximately 50 % of the lumen (Figure ). It localized at 4th centimeter distal to larynx. Histopathological diagnosis was adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea.\nThe patient underwent resection surgery. At the operational site, there were severe adhesions between the mediastinal surface and the trachea. Therefore, a conservative surgery was performed. The tumor was seen on the right anterolateral wall of the trachea being expanded submucosally from the carina to the proximal end of the trachea.\nThe patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy after the operation. CT scan of the neck revealed resolution of the tumor (Figure ). Now, 3 months after the operation, the patient has remained well.",

The patient had been treated elsewhere for one month for pain and redness of both breasts and fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C). There was no generalized lymphadenopathy. On gastroscopic examination multiple small ulcers were observed in the stomach. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed liver tumor and a normal spleen. Hematological and biochemical examination at admission showed the following results: RBC 352 \u00d7 104/mm3, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dl (post transfusion), WBC 4,900/mm3, Platelets 51,000/mm3, serum albumin 1.5 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, AST 691 IU/l, ALT 187 IU/l, LDH 2976 IU/l, fibrinogen 134 mg/dl, FDP 10 \u03bcg/ml, and AT-III 40%. Bleeding from the stomach continued and did not stop with conservative treatment; therefore, two days later the patient underwent total gastrectomy and a partial liver resection. Histopathology of the resected specimen showed it to be a gastric lymphoma (pleomorphic medium-large cell type, non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma) with liver metastasis (Fig. ). From first postoperative day (POD), bleeding from the esophagojejunostomy continued; the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and died on 8th postoperative day.\nOn autopsy, malignant lymphoid cell infiltration and hemophagocytosis were observed in the liver, spleen, heart, small bowel, lung, both breasts, kidney, pancreas, uterus, and gastroduodenal lymph nodes (Fig. ). The bone marrow presented hyperplasia and hemophagocytic macrophages but no infiltration by lymphoma cells. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells were positive for T-cell marker UCHL1 (CD45RO) and EBV by EBER in situ hybridization. The final diagnosis was EBV-related T-cell LAHS.",

        "title": "Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) of the uterine cervix associated with intraabdominal \"PEComatosis\": A clinicopathological study with comparative genomic hybridization analysis",
        "patient": "In October 2001, a left pelvic adnexal mass was palpated during a routine physical examination of a 41-year-old gravida-1 para-1 Caucasian female. The patient's past medical history was significant for tuberous sclerosis (diagnosed previously based on seizures, radiographic evidence suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cutaneous hypopigmented macules and bilateral cystic renal disease that culminated in end-stage renal disease in 1989). A transvaginal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous complex adnexal mass whose size was estimated at 7.0 \u00d7 4.8 cm. Also noted was a well-defined lesion (<1.0 cm) in the uterine cervix (figure ); the clinical impression of the latter lesion was a leiomyoma. CA-125 (13 U/ml) and CA19-9 (21 U/ml) levels were within normal limits. The decision was made to resect the adnexal mass and in November 2001, the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The surgical procedure was complicated by severe intra abdominal adhesions (secondary to long-term peritoneal dialysis), the lyses of which resulted in two inadvertent nicks to small bowel segments that necessitated the excision of those segments. The patient did not receive any adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, and she remains alive with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease after 35 months of close surveillance.\nStandard representative sections, including the entirety of the uterine cervix were processed routinely for microscopic examination. Sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Selected sections were stained for Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) with and without diastase pre-digestion. The immunohistochemical profile of the tumor was evaluated on 4\u03bc thick, formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections using a DAKO Autostainer (Carpinteria, CA, USA) based on the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Specifications for the various immunohistochemical stains that were utilized are listed in table . The extent and intensity of the immunoreactivity for each antibody was scored semi-quantitatively on a 1+(+) to 4+(++++) scale representing increasing staining extent and intensity. Labeling index for Ki-67 was calculated by assessing at least 4000 cells and determining the percentage showing unequivocal nuclear staining. In our literature review, the significance of the differences between the group means of two continuous variables (patient age and sizes of lesions) was determined using the student's t-test (Excel\u00ae, Microsoft Inc, Redmond, WA). DNA ploidy analysis was performed on isolated tumor nuclei according to standard procedures. Comparative genomic hybridization [] was performed on tumor tissue samples from the cervical mass as previously described [].\nGross and microscopic assessment of the left adnexal mass showed it to be a 7 cm hemorrhagic cyst devoid of any specific lining and involving the ovarian parenchyma. For the uterine cervical mass, a distinct lesion was not grossly appreciated. The ectocervical and endocervical surfaces and the endometrial cavity were described as unremarkable. Microscopically, the cervical mass was unencapsulated but possessed a deceptively circumscribed appearance at scanning magnification, attributable to the architectural homogeneity of its \"core\" (Figure ). However, the peripheral regions of the tumor showed a significant degree of infiltration. The tumor's maximal dimension was estimated at 2.2 cm, extending from just below the ectocervical basement membrane (Figure ) and extending proximally to the lower uterine segment and attaining 2 cm in depth (the peripheral limits of the tumor were at least 1 cm from the parametrial margins). The aforementioned central \"core\" (1 cm) was probably responsible for its radiographic appearance and consisted of fascicles of spindle cells with a smooth muscle appearance (Figure ). The spindle cells displayed bland nuclei with regularly distributed chromatin and only rarely conspicuous nucleoli. Towards the periphery, the spindle cells displayed increasingly PAS+, diastase sensitive cytoplasm (Figure ), although occasional cells displayed dense eosinophilia. At its most peripheral regions, the tumor was composed predominantly of solid sheets of large epithelioid cells with bland nuclear features, abundant clear cytoplasm, and well-defined cytoplasmic membranes. Although predominantly solid in the epithelioid regions, a pseudo-alveolar pattern was also evident (Figure ). At the most proximal regions near the lower uterine segment, the tumor appeared to be \"invading\" in single cells in a hyalinized stroma. The nuclei of the epithelioid cells showed a mild to moderate degree of nuclear atypia, manifested mostly as nucleomegaly and irregularity of nuclear membranes in the absence of hyperchromasia. Rare cells displayed bizarrely enlarged nuclei and multinucleation with a \"smudged\" chromatin pattern consistent with degenerative atypia (Figure ). Also identified in these regions were CD68+ foamy histiocytes mostly in single cells but occasionally in aggregates especially around the endocervical glands. No tumor necrosis was identified and mitotic figures were extremely sparse (<1/50 HPF). Small arching sinusoidal vessels were prominent throughout the tumor, but no large malformed vascular profiles were present. Pigment-laden cells and adipocytes were not present in the cervical mass. Small bowel segments measuring 21 cm in total length were also processed. Grossly, irregular areas of transmural thickening were noted. Microscopically, aggregates of epithelioid cells with more eosinophillic cytoplasm and vacuolated cytoplasm were noted in the lamina propria in two out of twelve sections (Figure ). In the both ovaries, similar aggregates of cells were present in a distinctive perivascular location in the hilar regions. These aggregates were either subendothelial (predominantly), adventitially attached to affected vessels, or present as free aggregates in the perihilar fat (Figure ). Each measured less than 1 mm in maximum dimension. No intraluminal tumor cells were seen. CGH and DNA ploidy analysis of the cervical mass showed a balanced chromosomal profile (figure ) and diploid nuclei, respectively. Immunohistochemically, both the epithelioid cells and spindle cells stained diffusely with HMB-45 (Figure ) and Melan-A in a cytoplasmic pattern at all sites (cervix, ovary, bowel). Scattered spindle cells showed unequivocal immunoreactivity for S100 while the epithelioid cells were negative. Both components showed at least focal immunoreactivity for muscle markers: smooth muscle actin and desmin with the spindle cells predominating both in the quantity of cell stained and the intensity of staining where positive. The complete immunohistochemical profile of the tumor is shown in table .",

Five years ago, he was diagnosed with hyperthyreosis caused by Plummer's disease. Laboratory findings revealed a repressed TSH of 0.01 mU/L (0.4\u20134.0 mU/L). The patient was treated with radioiodine therapy. Today he suffers from hypothyreosis and a daily substitution of 100 \u03bcg L-Thyroxin is performed. Within the months following the radioiodine therapy, an erythema progressing into a manifest pretibial myxedema developed, followed by exophthalmus and fibromatosis of the right hand within the next three years. Surgical orbita decompression due to massive exophthalmus was performed, followed by a subsequent correction of the ocular muscles. Additionally, the fibromatosis of the right hand was excised. Retrospective histological findings revealed a regressive sclerotic fibrosis of firm kollagenous fibers embedded in soft and fat tissue were consistent with a generalized fibrosing process as known in myxedema. Within the last months, decent mucous plaques of the upper limps decreased. The patient now reported progressing congestion of lymph and decreasing flexibility of the lower legs caused by the pretibial myxedema. Clinical examination confirmed massive pretibial myxedema, lymphatic congestion of the lower legs, generalized myxedema accentuating the upper limps, a residual postsurgical nodular tumor of the ulnar aspect of the right hand, exophthalmus, and severe hypertrophic osteopathy of the distal phalanges with clubbed fingers and hippocratic nails (Fig. ). A Complete check-up including autoantibodies remained unremarkable. Under substitution of 100 \u03bcg L-Throxin daily we found the following thyroidal values: T3 0.94 ng/ml (0.59\u20131.74), T4 10.17 \u03bcg/dl (4.50\u201312.00), TSH 0.47 \u03bcIE/ml (0.38\u20134.70), fT3 2.64 pg/ml (1.45\u20133.48), fT4 1.44 ng/dl (0.71\u20131.85). There were no hints for additional fibromatosis.

He had then experienced symptoms for a few years that had aggravated during the last six to eight months. Using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rate Scale (MADRS) the patient scored 24 points and was diagnosed as having a clinical depression. He did not take any medication and had no regular medical contact. The patient did not have any history of allergy or dermatological diseases. However, he sometimes suffered from vasomotor rhinitis after drinking red wine. The doctor prescribed fluoxetine 20 mg daily as antidepressive treatment. At the revisit three weeks later the patient was very pleased with the fluoxetine treatment and reported that he \"had not felt better in 20 years\" although he initially had experienced slight nausea and insomnia.\nA week later, he visited his doctor due to an itching rash that had started the day before. The doctor noted partly confluent urticae on the abdomen, a modest periorbital oedema and red, warm palms and wrists. An ADR induced by fluoxetine was suspected and fluoxetine treatment was discontinued. The symptoms were treated with 2 mg clemastine and 6 mg betametasone orally and disappeared within 48 hours. However, the symptoms of depression returned. Sertraline medication was initiated 10 days after the cessation of fluoxetine treatment since SSRI medication had shown good effect. During the weeks of sertraline treatment no urticarial symptoms appeared. The patient improved in his depression although full recovery was not achieved this time. After approximately two weeks of sertraline treatment he noted an intense itching sensation in his scalp after eating a piece of chocolate cake. The itch spread to the arms, abdomen and legs within a few hours. This time the patient did not seek his doctor but treated himself with clemastine and the itch disappeared during the night. He now remembered that he had had a chocolate mousse dessert before the first episode. Since he had never had any reaction from eating chocolate before, he found this observation so striking that he reported it to his doctor. The patient, himself a scientist, later tried small doses of chocolate and skin rash and itch appeared at an intensity that to him seemed dependent on the \"dose\" of chocolate ingested.\nIt has been known for 30 years that serotonin can stimulate cutaneous C-fibres [], the type of fibres that is also known to transmit itch []. Moreover, serotonin injections into the skin can induce itch [] and pruritus is a component in 24% of reported skin reactions to fluoxetine in Sweden, the corresponding figure for sertraline is 15 % []. However, attempts to treat pruritus using 5-HT3-receptor-antagonists have not given clear-cut results [-]. The enzymes necessary for conversion of tryptophan to serotonin are expressed in human skin []. In addition, 5-HT2AR are present in one third of unmyelinated axons at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area []. An altered localisation pattern of serotonin receptors 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR and 5-HT3R has been reported in contact eczematous skin together with increased serotonin concentrations [,] indicating the presence of a serotonin system in the skin that can be altered in pathologic conditions. Moreover, a cross-sensitivity has been reported when skin rash developed after both paroxetine and sertraline medication []. Since these substances are structurally different, one interpretation is that the skin can react to an SSRI-induced increase in serotonin concentrations.\nIn the present case the patient experienced skin symptoms from two different SSRIs. However, these symptoms occurred only when he had eaten chocolate. Chocolate contains serotonin, at concentrations which depend on the type of chocolate []. A concentration of 1.4 \u2013 5 \u03bcg / g has been reported in dark chocolate []. The present report suggests an interaction between SSRI-medication and chocolate leading to pruritus and rash. A plausible explanation is that SSRI together with serotonin-containing chocolate has increased serotonin concentration to a level where 5-HT receptors system at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area are affected. Moreover, the patient in this case had previously noted nasal congestion and cough when he was drinking red wine. Red wine can induce release of serotonin from platelets [] and from the gut []. Serotonin can induce nasal itch, sneeze and hypersecretion [,].",

        "patient": "A previously healthy 32-year-old man was referred to the emergency department of orthopedics with traumatic injuries of the index, middle and ring fingers of the left hand. The injury happened at work while he was operating a machine of cotton elaboration.\nOn admission, routine laboratory investigations showed only elevated white blood cell count (12,400/mm3), while red blood cell count, haemoglobin, chemistry and urine analysis were within normal limits. Radiography of the bones of his left hand revealed fractures of the nail bones of the middle and the ring finger. Surgical debridement of the damaged soft tissue was undertaken with amputation of these two nail bones. The patient was hospitalized and intravenous therapy with ceforanide (1 g/12 h), ofloxacin (200 mg/12 h) and metronidazole (500 mg/8 h) was initiated.\nFour days after his admission the injury of the hand became tender, erythematous, swelling and began to drain. The purulent material expressed from the hand was sent for culture. Three days later the lesion worsened and was complicated with lymphangitis. The patient was noted to be febrile (38.5\u00b0C) without any other systemic symptoms.\nPhysical examination revealed multiple erythematous subcutaneous nodules along the lymphatics extending up the patient's left forearm. These nodules were tender and painful. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Debridement of the lesions was performed and the tissue was submitted for bacterial and fungal cultures. The Gram-stained smear showed polymorphonuclear leucocytes and Gram-positive fine, branching filaments, partially acid-fast, with a tendency to fragment into coccoid and bacillary forms.\nLaboratory tests showed: white blood cell count (18,000/mm3), absolute neutrophil count, 12,780/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 75 mm/h; and C-reactive protein, 14.2 mg/dl (normal < 0.8 mg/dl).\nAfter 5 days of incubation cultures of the pus and the tissue on Columbia blood agar grew white colonies adherent to the agar, rough with a velvety surface, having a characteristic mouldy odor (Figure ). Colonial characteristics, physiological properties and biochemical tests performed identified the isolate as Nocardia brasiliensis (Table ). Susceptibility to the antibiotics by the determination of the MICs using the E-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), showed that the isolate was sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and minocycline, intermediate to ciprofloxacin and resistant to ampicillin, second and third generation cephalosporins, erythromycin, clindamycin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin. The patient's antimicrobial therapy was changed to intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg b.i.d). The patient responded to therapy. Following 2 weeks of treatment the patient improved and all laboratory tests returned to normal. He was discharged 3 weeks after his admission on oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg b.i.d). The antibiotic therapy was continued for a total of 3 months. His hand and arm lesions were healing well and 6 months later revealed complete resolution of the infection without signs of recurrence.",

        "title": "Supracubital perineurioma misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome: case report",
        "patient": "Three years after a cubital procaine-HCL 0.05% injection had caused acute severe local pain radiating to his forearm and wrist, a 33-year old man complained about pain in his right hand. Two months later, he also suffered from numbness in the distribution of the right median nerve and wasting of thenar muscles. Furthermore a muscular atrophy in his right forearm was noted. Nerve conduction studies showed an increased distal latency in the median nerve, a very low thenar compound muscle action potential on median nerve stimulation, a reduced sensory conduction velocity of 39 m/s in the median nerve on thumb stimulation and no sensory nerve action potential on stimulation of the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Electromyography of the right biceps brachii muscle was normal. In the fibrillations, an increased duration and amplitude of motor unit potentials and reduced recruitment pattern were found in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Forearm muscles were not investigated. A carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed and treated by surgery.\nTen months later the patient was admitted to our department because of persistence of his symptoms. Nerve conduction studies showed no response over the thenar muscle on median nerve stimulation at the wrist and elbow. Fibrillations and sparse motor unit potentials with increased duration and amplitude (up to 10 mV) were found in flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, in contrast to the normal Electromyography-findings of the right flexor carpi ulnaris. On median nerve stimulation at the elbow a low compound muscle action potential with an increased distal latency was recorded over flexor digitorum superficialis muscle in the right side (right: amplitude 1 mV, latency 9.0 ms, left: amplitude 7 mV, latency 3.2 ms). No sensory nerve action potential was recorded at the wrist on stimulation of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd finger. Somatosensory evoked potentials of the left median and right radial and ulnar nerve were normal. No potential was recorded at Erb's point in the supraclavicular fossa, at the sixth and second cervical vertebra and the contralateral cortex on median nerve stimulation on the right.\nProximal median nerve lesion was suggested. Palpation along the median nerve revealed a fusiform mass at the distal third of the right upper arm, which could be confirmed by MRI (see figure and ).\nSurgical resection of a 7 cm long segment of the median nerve with the tumorous lesion and replacement with a sural nerve graft was undertaken. Resection was necessary because of severe involvement of fascicles without any possibility to separate the tumour from the median nerve by micro-surgery. Histological investigation revealed marked peri- and endoneurial fibrosis, severe axonal loss as well as proliferation of concentric whorl-like formations resulting in multicompartment arrangement. These pseudo onion-bulb formations showed strong immunoreactivity for the epithelial membrane antigen and were predominantly negative for S-100 protein, suggesting a proliferation of perineurial cells rather than Schwann cells. In addition, small groups of regenerating axonal sprouts surrounded by perineurial ensheathment were visible, indicating some neuroma-like component (see figure and ).\nThe tumour was diagnosed as perineurioma and additional neuroma by histopathology. On clinical follow-up four years later a partial recovery of forearm muscle strength could be noted and the patient was free from pain.",

        "patient": "A 59-year-old male, working in a quarry, was admitted to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain persisting for 45 days, afternoon fever, fatigue and 8 kg weight loss during the last month. Previous medical history was non contributory. He was a heavy smoker for 45 years.\nAt first assessment, the patient presented with disseminated dry rales and decrease of vesicular murmur in the right upper lung field. Following abdominal examination, palpable smooth surface masses were discovered in both renal areas. Laboratory tests demonstrated a significant anemia with normocytic features (hematocrit 24%, Hb 7.2 mg/dl).\nChest X-ray revealed a consolidated area in the right upper lobe of the lung. Abdomen ultrasound demonstrated large masses with foci of hemorrhagic necrosis in both adrenal glands (Figure ).\nComputed tomographic (CT) -scan revealed an invasive process in the right upper lobe of the lung (Figure ) and large masses of heterogeneous texture, with hemorrhagic and necrotic elements within both adrenal glands (Figure ).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed which showed the masses with disseminated foci of high, heterogeneous signal intensity and pathologic enhancement after intravenous (i.v.) administration of contrast agent in both T1 and T2 weighted sequences. Radiological features were suggestive of adrenal metastasis from lung primary (Figures , ). Histological examination of the biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a large-cell carcinoma of the lung. The patient showed significant deterioration and was hospitalized again for altered level of consciousness, blurring of vision, tinnitus, lability and intense fatigue. Laboratory examination demonstrated severe leukocytosis with 98,000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, compatible with the leukemoid reaction within the framework of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Hematocrit (Ht) levels dropped significantly a second time (Ht: 21%, Hb: 6.9 mg/dl), the biochemical parameters were normal, while the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test excluded the possibility of cortical adrenal failure (serum cortisol basal value: 9\u03bcg/dl and 34\u03bcg/dl six hours following intramuscular (i.m.) administration of 1 mg of ACTH). A repeat abdominal ultrasound revealed numerous hemorrhagic elements inside the adrenal masses. The patient received urgent chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with simultaneous supportive treatment. Following chemotherapy, leukocytes decreased progressively, while symptoms related to the central nervous system (CNS) improved, however, the patient died suddenly on the fifth day following chemotherapy. Autopsy was not performed. The physician's on-call medical report documented a typical cardiac arrest, without evidence of acute hemorrhage in adrenal mass.",

        "patient": "A 77 year old female presented to her primary care physician with a complaint of a right buttock mass. Her past medical history was significant for colonic adenocarcinoma treated surgically, twelve years prior. The skin overlying the 2 \u00d7 3 cm firm, non-fluctuant, non-tender mass was erythematous. Initially the mass was thought to be a boil or carbuncle. Six weeks later during a visit with a surgical oncologist for routine follow-up of her colonic adenocarcinoma resected 13 years prior, the patient noted that the mass was becoming quite painful and enlarging rapidly. The patient was then taken to the OR for local excision. Pathology revealed a small round blue cell tumor forming large nests and infiltrating as single cells between thick strands of fibrous tissue in the dermis and extending to the subcutaneous fat. There were abundant mitoses, a lack of necrosis or obvious vascular invasion. The epidermis was uninvolved. The histologic and immunochemical findings supported the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. A wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. One sentinel lymph node was negative for malignancy and there was no residual tumor identified in the excision. No adjuvant therapy was given.\nTen months after the initial presentation the patient had increasing shoulder pain that radiated into the chest and flank. A CT of the thoracic spine revealed a 3.0 cm mass in the area of the fourth thoracic (T4) vertebra. A CT guided needle biopsy of the area revealed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. A bone scan revealed additional areas of concern in the right humerus and bilateral distal femurs. The patient received radiation therapy to the thoracic spine and right distal femur for palliation of bone pain.\nA year after first presenting for a right buttock mass, the patient was admitted to the hospital for increasing dyspnea. A chest radiograph revealed a large right pleural effusion, which was drained for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The fluid was grossly bloody and cytology revealed abundant, round, basophilic single cells, many in mitosis, with characteristic granular, \"salt and pepper\" nuclear chromatin (Figure ). A cellblock was made and immunohistochemical staining with CK20 revealed characteristic positivity in a dot like rim pattern (Figures ).",

We performed two courses of systemic chemotherapy using bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, leading to a partial response. As the tumor size was not seemed to decrease after the two courses of the chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed, but failed to show any residual viable cells. An ultrasonic study did not reveal any testicular tumors. About 4 years after the previous treatment, he presented with scrotal enlargement and tumor markers such as AFP and HCG \u03b2 were within normal limit.

There was no history of chronic liver disease. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal except for esophageal varices. Computerized tomography of the thorax revealed a mass on the left anterolateral chest wall (Figure ). Cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate taken from the mass was consistent with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (Figure ). Abdominal computerized tomography detected thrombosis in the right portal vein. The liver parenchyma was diffusely heterogeneous with irregular borders and without a clear mass or infiltrating lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy on thoracic, abdominal or pelvic computerized tomography. The patient had an elevated serum alpha-feto protein (AFP) level of 60 000 ng/mL (0 \u2013 13.6 ng/ml).

        "patient": "A 34-year-old female presented with a 3 year history of a palpable swelling and mild pain in the left gluteal region. There was no history of preceding trauma or accident. Two years after initiation of symptoms without clinical progress, the patient became pregnant and noted a local growth of the mass. After giving birth to a healthy child, the patient consulted an orthopedic surgeon. A radiographic image of the pelvis revealed a large osteolytic lesion in the left iliac wing, sharply contoured with sclerotic margins, indicating a slow growth pattern (Figure ). MR-imaging of the pelvis showed a mass originating from the os ilium with a large extra- and intrapelvic soft-tissue component (Figure ). Open biopsy was performed that lead to the diagnosis of BFH.\nAfter reference to the literature on BFH, surgical en bloc resection was considered to be the appropriate treatment modality [,,,]. In accordance to the imaging results, the iliac crest could be preserved, while the linea terminalis of the left side had to be resected (Figure ). Figure shows the resected tumor specimen. Histological study of the resected specimen confirmed the diagnosis of BFH (Figure ). The surgical margins were found to be free of tumor confirming complete tumor resection.\nThe pelvic ring was then stabilized in a second operation using a non-vascularized fibular autograft that was impacted and stabilized with screws and a Kirschner-wire reconstructing the linea terminalis of the left pelvic ring (Figure ). Post operatively she developed neurapraxia of the left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which resolved spontaneously within 6 months after surgery. Following two weeks of bed rest and limited restriction of movement up to 70\u00b0 flexion of the hip joint, the patient was mobilized with partial weight bearing for three months.\nRadiographic and MRI controls at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively showed no evidence of local recurrence or secondary dislocation of the reconstruction (Figure ). A diastasis of the symphysis was noted, which we ascribe to the pregnancy one year prior to surgery. After 18 months of surgery the patient is free of disease and ambulates with full weight bearing.",

Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland and the neck showed a suspicious prevertebral mass. CT scan of the thorax and neck detected a paraesophageal mediastinal mass close to the thoracic inlet. (Figure ) 99mTc sestamibi scintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. (Figure ).\nAfter the complete subsidence of acute pancreatitis and the return of calcium serum levels at values less than 12 g/dl by hydration, the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) which failed to show bile duct lithiasis. With a diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma, resection of the parathyroid adenoma via a collar cervical incision was carried out. The tumor was easily separated from the surrounded structures (vertebra, trachea, and esophagus) by blunt dissection and the feeding vessels were found and ligated anteriorly. (Figure ) The patient had a 6 days uneventful hospital stay. Calcium and parathyroid hormone serum levels returned to normal within 48 hours from the end of operation. A slight serum hypocalcaemia was observed over the following days and the patient received oral therapy with calcium and vitamin D to restore serum calcium levels within normal range values.",

        "title": "Pancreatic metastasis from gastric carcinoma: a case report",
        "patient": "A 60-year-old woman presented with elevated blood levels of the tumor markers CEA (17.3 \u03bcg/L, normal <2.5 \u03bcg/L) and CA 19-9 (121 U/ml, normal <37 U/ml). Four years before being referred to our institution, the patient had undergone gastric resection (Billroth II gastrectomy) for an adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The tumor was located at the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum, measuring 3 cm in the largest diameter. Pathologic examination revealed a gastric carcinoma of low differentiation, which infiltrated the gastric wall into the subserosal layer without penetrating the serosa. Microscopically, the carcinoma was mainly composed of tubular formations of mitotically active, atypical epithelial cells (Figure ). The tumor also displayed areas of marked desmoplastic stromal reaction, as well as areas of rather glandular differentiation. The latter two were mainly observed in paragastric lymph node metastases (Figure ). The carcinoma at stage pT2 pN1 (6/15) M0 G2 was completely resected (R0 resection). No recurrence was detected during the regular follow-ups.\nFour years after gastric resection, however, ultrasound examination, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an inhomogeneous mass of the pancreatic head, measuring 4 cm in largest diameter (Figure ). Radiographically, no other masses were detected. For differential diagnosis, a primary carcinoma of the pancreas and a metastasis of the gastric carcinoma were considered. Following explorative laparotomy, the pancreatic mass was resected performing a partial pancreatoduodenectomy with resection of the distal bile duct (Whipple's procedure). Furthermore, the former gastroenterostomy was resected and revised. On pathologic examination, the tumor of the pancreatic head grossly presented as white to yellowish, firm mass. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of solid and glandular formations of atypical epithelial cells with distinct nuclear pleomorphism and presented marked desmoplastic stromal reaction, as well as areas of necrosis (Figure ). The duodenal wall and the peripancreatic tissue were infiltrated by the tumor. Lymph node metastases were detected in two peripancreatic lymph nodes. The histomorphological appearance of the pancreatic tumor was in good accordance to some areas of the primary gastric tumor, and especially the growth pattern found in the paragastric lymph node metastases coped well with the microscopic picture found in the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed identical expression patterns in the gastric carcinoma and the pancreatic mass, both displaying positive reactions with antibodies towards cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19, as well as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), whereas no reactions were seen with antibodies towards cytokeratins 7 and 20. Because of these findings and due to the lack of pancreatic cancer progenitor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), within the non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue of the Whipple's resection specimen, the pancreatic tumor and the two regional lymph node metastases were considered to be metastases of the primary gastric carcinoma.\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital without any perioperative morbidity on the ninth postoperative day. The postoperative blood levels of the tumor markers declined to normal values (CEA 2.6 \u03bcg/l, CA 19-9 24 U/ml). Due to the complete surgical resection and the lack of risk factors for recurrence, the patient received no further adjuvant therapy. Under regular follow-up for one year with determination of the tumor markers and computed tomography, the patient revealed no signs or symptoms of local or systemic recurrence.",

        "patient": "This is a fifty-one year old female patient with history of diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematoses (SLE) complicated by lupus nephritis. Although we have included her case in our previous publication [], we have not reported her clinical details at that time. She was put on prednisolone 30 mg and azathioprine 100 mg daily since end of June and mid-July 2002, respectively. She was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on 11th August 2002 for investigation of jaundice. Investigations revealed deranged liver function tests with cholestatic pattern. A diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity was entertained, and azathioprine was stopped after admission. As her autoimmune disease was under control, her steroid dosage was reduced from 25 mg to 15 mg daily within the next 14 days. Her CXR taken on admission was normal.\nSoon after her immunosuppressive therapy was tapered, she developed fever and non-productive cough. A repeat CXR performed on 9th Sept revealed new infiltrate over the left mid-zone, suggestive of pneumonia. She was started on intravenous ceftazidime 1 gram eight hourly and oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. Serial CXR performed three days later showed increasing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and worsening hypoxemia. There was an upsurge of total lymphocyte count from 0.7 \u00d7 109/L (total white cell count 7.2 \u00d7 109/L) at the time of admission to 5.6 \u00d7 109/L (total white cell count 10.8 \u00d7 109/L) at the time of clinical deterioration. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy performed on the same day revealed Pneumocystitis jiroveci by methenamine sliver stain. Workup for other opportunistic pathogens including cytomegalovirus and aspergillus was negative. She was commenced on intravenous pentamidine (4 mg/kg/day) and corticosteroids for severe PCP infection. Despite active treatment she developed progressive respiratory failure and required admission to intensive care unit. She subsequently recovered after a stormy hospital course, and upon discharge from hospital, her total lymphocyte count had returned to her baseline of 0.86 \u00d7 109/L.",

        "title": "The unmasking of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia during reversal of immunosuppression: case reports and literature review",
        "patient": "A thirty-three year old gentleman initially presented to Prince of Wales Hospital with a diagnosis of SLE/dermatomyositis overlap syndrome. He was treated with steroid and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily since 1997. He had a flare up of disease in May 1998 with active vasculitis and myositis, for which he was put on prednisolone and azthioprine 50 mg and 100 mg daily respectively. Upon reassessment one month later, disease activity was under control, and the dosage of prednisolone was reduced to 45 mg daily.\nTwelve day after reducing the immunosuppressive regimen, he was admitted to hospital for treatment of left buttock abscess. The CXR taken on admission was unremarkable. An aspirate of the pus from the lesion grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; he was treated with cloxacillin 1 g intravenously every 6 hourly, together with incision and drainage of the buttock abscess. In view of the underlying active pyogenic infection, the steroid dosage was rapidly tapered from 45 mg to 15 mg daily within the next four days. However, he was noted to have persistent fever associated with mild unproductive cough. A repeat chest radiograph showed new infiltrates over the right upper and left lower zones, and he was empirically treated with intravenous ceftazidime 1 gram every 8 hours, cloxacillin 1 gram every 6 hours and netimicin 100 mg every 8 hours. As there was no clinical response after 5 days of treatment, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, which was positive for Pneumocystis jiroveci. Investigation for the presence of co-existing opportunistic pathogens such as cytomegalovirus and aspergillus was negative. On the day after bronchoscopy, he was commenced on intravenous cotrimoxazole 1.3 grams every 6 hours. He remained stable initially with fever on downward trend. However, on the 3rd day of treatment, he developed sudden desaturation with resurgence of high fever, and required supplemental oxygen therapy. Repeat chest radiograph showed increased perihilar hazziness in both lung fields. There was also an upsurge of total lymphocyte count from 0.6 \u00d7 109/L (total white cell count 11.2 \u00d7 109/L) on admission, to 1.3 \u00d7 109/L (total white cell count 10.4 \u00d7 109/L) at the time of clinical deterioration. He was treated with high dose prednisolone (80 mg daily), and his condition improved promptly afterwards. He was subsequently discharged, and on follow up at the clinic one month later, his total lymphocyte count had returned to his baseline level of 0.6 \u00d7 109/L.\nImmunorestitution disease (IRD) has been described in both HIV and non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts previously [-]. In the setting of PCP, it is defined as an acute symptomatic presentation of the disease that is related temporally to the recovery of the immune system, associated with reversal of immunosuppressive processes such as reduction in the dosage of corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic agents or a reduction of HIV viral load due to HAART, which results in the development of immunopathological damage. The preexisting microbial infection could be either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Using this case definition, we attempted to review the English literature for other reported cases of PCP manifesting as IRD. The English-language literature (1966 \u2013 2003) was searched in the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine in October 2003. The keywords \"Pneumocystis carinii\", \"Pneumocystis jiroveci\", \"HIV\", immunosuppression\", \"immunosuppressive\", \"steroid\", and \"corticosteroid\" were used to select cases. All the case reports and case series with clinical details were included in this study if they fulfilled the above definition of IRD. When appropriate, the cited bibliographies were also retrieved for further analysis. As for statistical analysis, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, a non-parametric test for comparing paired samples, to analyze the serial changes in lymphocyte counts and HIV viral loads before and during the development of IRD. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows.\nIncluding our present case, a total of 29 cases of PCP in non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts fulfilling our definition of IRD have been reported in the literature (table ) [-,]. There were altogether 13 males and 8 females, with a median age of 38 years (range 2 to 75 years). The age and sex were not mentioned in 8 cases. Their underlying immunosuppressive conditions included solid organ tumours (13 cases), haematological diseases (8), autoimmune diseases (4), endogenous Cushing's disease (3), and a solid organ transplant recipient (1). All patients had received steroids or had excessive endogenous steroid production, whereas 18 (62.1%) of them had concomitant cytotoxic therapy for the underlying diseases. The median duration between steroid tapering and clinical manifestations of PCP was 21 days (range 1 to 83 days). Steroids were completely withdrawn at a median of 7.5 days (range 1 to 21 days) before the onset of symptoms in eight patients. Serial lymphocyte counts were only available in eight patients. An upsurge of the absolute lymphocyte counts was observed from the time of reduction of immunosuppression (median 300/\u03bcL, range 290 to 600/\u03bcL at baseline) to the time of occurrence of IRD (median 1200/\u03bcL, range 600 to 5620/\u03bcL); the median increase in total lymphocyte count was 800/\u03bcL, with a range of 300 to 4880/\u03bcL. Comparing the lymphocyte counts before and after reversal of immunosuppressive therapy, the difference was statistically significant (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for paired samples; p = 0.012). In addition to our patient, reintroduction or increasing doses of steroids were required in 7 (53.8%) of 13 patients in the acute management of PCP in the literature, at the time when they developed clinical deterioration during antimicrobial therapy [-]. Seven (53.8%) of 13 cases had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Among these 29 cases, 13 (44.8%) subsequently died of PCP.\nAmong HIV-positive patients, 13 cases with newly diagnosed PCP were reported in the literature, in which IRD occurred shortly after the introduction of HAART (table ) [-]. Seven (53.8%) out of 13 cases received steroids as adjunctive therapy in addition to antimicrobials. HAART was given in all cases at a median 18 days (range 1 to 35 days) after the initiation of treatment for PCP. During IRD, recurrence of fever (100%), dyspnoea (100%), and paradoxical worsening of pulmonary infiltrates (58.3%) were observed in these patients [-]. IRD occurred at a median of 14 days (range 5 to 17 days) after HAART. An upsurge of the CD4 lymphocyte count was observed before (median 28/\u03bcL, range 4 to 290/\u03bcL) and during IRD (median 125/\u03bcL, range 30 to 564/\u03bcL); this was associated with a concomitant reduction of the median HIV viral load from 5.5 log10 copies/ml (range 5.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ml) to 3.1 log10 copies/ml (range 2.9 to 4.5 log10 copies/ml) before and during IRD respectively, and the differences observed in both the CD4 counts and viral loads before and during IRD reached statistical significance (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for related samples; p = 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). Antimicrobials, steroids, or both for PCP were reintroduced for IRD in 4, 1, and 6 cases respectively. Only 2 cases were treated conservatively. One case required mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory distress. None of the patients died.\nPCP manifesting as a form of IRD is not a rare phenomenon. As shown in our previous study, it happens in 7 out of 10 (70%) of HIV-negative immunosuppressed hosts infected with Pj []. However, the diagnosis of PCP is usually delayed in this group of patients because of atypical presentation. In this clinical setting, PCP manifesting as IRD often runs an acute and fulminant course, with nonspecific lesions on chest radiographs, and high absolute lymphocyte counts []. In our own reported series, despite the administration of steroid therapy to suppress the immunopathological damage, more than 80% of patients developed acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Patients who developed PCP during reversal of immunosuppressive therapy in our series tended to be older, and this might partially explain the increased mortality observed in this group [].\nRapid reduction of immunosuppressive therapy such as steroids has been implicated as a predisposing factor for the development of PCP in HIV-negative patients [,,,]. In one study, PCP occurred in 79 (70%) of 113 patients during steroid tapering []. Another study suggested that 8 (72.2%) out of 11 episodes of PCP developed when steroid therapy was tapered []. A subsequent study also demonstrated that 43% of patients had a rapid reduction of steroid dosing before the clinical manifestations of PCP []. A similar experience was reported in children, and 17 (89.5%) out of 19 children were diagnosed to have PCP during steroid tapering according to a previous report []. Another series revealed that 7 of 11 patients experienced acutely symptomatic PCP when the dose of steroids was decreased or terminated 5 days to 3 weeks before the diagnosis of PCP []. However, all these cases were not analyzed from a perspective of IRD. Serial changes of the absolute lymphocyte counts or their subsets were either not noted or reported [,,-]. Hence we have not included these cases for further analysis in this review.\nAmong HIV positive patients, PCP manifesting acutely during the initiation anti-retroviral therapy is a well-recognized phenomenon. The underlying immunopathological nature of this condition, which is reminiscent to IRD occurring in non-HIV infected patients, has been confirmed by histological examination of the lungs and transbronchial biopsy specimens, which demonstrated mixed inflammatory infiltrates including macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Almost all infiltrating lymphocytes found in the tissues were of the T cell lineage, shown by immunophenotyping to be predominantly CD4 and CD8 cells []. In another study [], the BAL fluid obtained from one of six patients with an IRD-type presentation of PCP was analyzed. Infiltration of predominantly CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes with the proliferative marker (Ki67) and perforin-positive cell were seen in the BAL specimen. Therefore, it is likely that the phagocytosed Pj is presented by alveolar macrophage to T cells, which trigger the inflammatory response [].\nIn our own experience, as well as from the review of published literature, it appears that a surge of absolute lymphocyte count, especially the CD4 lymphocyte count in HIV-positive patients, could potentially act as a surrogate marker for immunopathological damage during IRD in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. In our recent publication [], 7 out of 10 non-HIV immunosuppressed patients demonstrated a consistent rise in the absolute lymphocyte count during tapering of immunosuppression prior to the onset of symptomatic PCP. In this group of patients, the surge in lymphocyte count is likely the result of withdrawal of lymphocytotoxic immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids. Similarly, a rising trend of the CD4 lymphocyte count, consistent with immune reconstitution after HAART, was also observed in 13 HIV-positive cases before and during the development of symptomatic PCP [-]. In fact, an upsurge in the absolute lymphocyte count has been shown to be a marker of IRD in our previous publications involving viral and tuberculous infections [-]. However, it must be emphasized that the number of circulating lymphocytes may not always correlate with their number in the affected tissues or their in vivo functional activity. This can be exemplified by a case of PCP occurring during steroid withdrawal, in which the lymphocyte counts surged to a very high level and then rapidly dropped to a low level within one day. The migration of lymphocytes from the circulation to tissue might explain this rapid drop in lymphocyte count and the resulting immunopathological damage []. In the future, further studies on lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles of susceptible hosts during the development of IRD should be performed to elucidate the underlying immunopathological mechanisms behind this interesting phenomenon.\nFrom the result of this review, it appears that HIV-positive patients with PCP are at risk of clinical deterioration due to IRD if HAART therapy is started within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment for PCP (table ). With a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms resulting in IRD, we may be able to prevent the occurrence of IRD by delaying the initiation of HAART in HIV-positive patients with PCP. However, in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients, it is even more important to recognize the atypical presentations of PCP in the context of IRD. Since the clinical and/or radiological features alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis, analysis of serial changes in lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing a reduction of immunosuppression can alert the clinician to the possibility of IRD due to occult pathogens such as Pj. To prevent IRD in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients, the use of prophylactic antibiotics against Pj to reduce the microbial load in selected patients remains an important issue. Recently, a multi-center study showed that the CD4 lymphocyte count may be a useful marker to monitor the risk of development of PCP in non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts [], and patients with low CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 300 or 400 may require prophylaxis. In fact, asymptomatic colonization of Pj has been demonstrated in HIV-negative patients when the CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 400 []. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified a significant percentage of clinically silent Pj colonization in 20% of non-HIV immunosuppressed patients []. Therefore, early detection of asymptomatic infection of Pj in blood and respiratory specimens before, and during intense immunosuppression may enable selection of cases for pre-emptive treatment of Pj infection in order to prevent the development of IRD during reversal of immunosuppression [,].",

        "title": "Successful obstetrical management of 110-day intertwin delivery interval without cerclage: counseling and conservative management approach to extreme asynchronous twin birth",
        "patient": "A 30 year-old non-smoking Caucasian G3P1011 presented for initial prenatal assessment at six weeks gestation. The conception was established without medical assistance. The patient had no significant medical or surgical history. She underwent an uncomplicated curettage for missed abortion four years before presentation and an uneventful term vaginal delivery occurred two years later.\nTransvaginal ultrasound at seven weeks gestation revealed a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy. At 18 weeks gestation no growth discordance was noted, but cervical length was two cm with funneling. Based on these findings, the patient was counseled about maternal and neonatal risks associated with twin pregnancy, particularly the risk of preterm labor due to cervical shortening. Although rescue cerclage was offered to the patient, this option was declined. She was therefore placed on bedrest for two weeks with follow-up ultrasonography for assessment of cervical length.\nAt 192/7 weeks gestation the patient experienced abdominal cramping and non-purulent blood-tinged vaginal discharge. The patient remained afebrile. She was hospitalized and placed on bed rest in Trendelenburg position after sterile speculum exam found the cervix two cm dilated with protruding \"hourglass membranes\".\nOne day later, amniotic membranes had fully retracted and were no longer visible above a closed cervix. Microscopic examination of vaginal fluid found occasional clue cells. External monitoring identified occasional uterine contractions; heart rates at ~150/min were measured for both twins. The patient was again counseled about the implications of preterm labor at this early stage, and the uncertainty of preventing further cervical dilation. After consideration of all therapeutic options (including cerclage), the patient elected tocolysis with a view to save her pregnancy. A 4 g loading dose of magnesium sulfate was administered intravenously, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 g/h. Oral metronidazole (500 mg) was given every 8 h, and 500 mg ampicillin was given intravenously every 6 h after a 2 gm loading dose according to hospital protocol. Additionally, oral indomethacin (50 mg) was given every 6 h for 3 days. Just as the magnesium sulfate was initiated, the patient experienced spontaneous rupture of membranes and prolapse of umbilical cord of twin A was noted several hours later. Fetal demise was confirmed approximately 1 h later, but there was no evidence of labor or infection over the next 24 h. After discussing the potential dangers of prolonged rupture of membranes, retention of dead fetus, maternal sepsis, the potential for prolonged hospitalization, need for hysterectomy and risk of death, the patient elected to continue limited oxytocin augmentation in an attempt to deliver twin A and salvage twin B. The risk of losing both fetuses was carefully discussed, and the patient agreed with this management approach despite the acknowledged uncertainty of outcome.\nAfter 8 h of oxytocin therapy, a stillborn female fetus (319 g) was delivered. The placenta remained in situ and the umbilical cord of twin A was divided and ligated near the cervix with 3-0 chromic gut suture. Oxytocin was immediately discontinued. Monitoring of twin B confirmed stable heart tones and appropriate fetal movement throughout delivery of the non-viable twin. Intravenous ampicillin and metronidazole were continued postpartum but MgSO4 was not reinitiated. Immediately following delivery of twin A, sterile speculum exam found a closed cervix with the umbilical cord completely retracted in utero. Maternal vital signs remained stable and she was discharged home one week later on full bed rest, preterm labor precautions, and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg) twice daily \u00d7 5 d.\nAt 25 weeks gestation, 12 mg betamethasone was administered intramuscularly with an additional dose 24 h later. There was no evidence of infection or coagulopathy at biweekly clinical evaluations, which included serial ultrasounds until 34 weeks to assess cervical length. Formal biophysical profiles (BPP) began at 28 weeks, when the estimated fetal weight was 1250 g and the BPP score was 8/8. At this time mild uterine irritability was detected and 5 mg oral terbutaline was given every 4 h until 34 weeks. Uterine activity was reduced following oral terbutaline therapy.\nSpontaneous labor began at 35 1/7 weeks. At readmission, the cervix was 5 cm dilated with intact membranes and vertex presentation. Epidural anesthesia was established, an amniotomy was performed, and the patient had a normal progress of labor. She delivered a viable male infant weighting 2894 g (1 and 5 min Apgar 9 and 9, respectively) over an intact perineum. Approximately 5 min later, two placentas were delivered spontaneously (Figure ). The postpartum course was uncomplicated; mother and baby were discharged home in stable condition 48 h later.",

        "patient": "A 76-year-old man with a painful, ulcerative swelling of the glans that had appeared less than 2 months previously was brought to our attention. Physical examination revealed a 3.5-cm fungating lesion involving the upper half of the glans [Fig. ]. The lesion was malodorous with varying amounts of seropurulent discharge, partially ulcerated, erythematous, and slightly itchy. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes were not palpable. No similar lesions were evident on the head, neck, trunk, or arms. The patient had been treated in another hospital 8 years previously for TCC of the left renal pelvis by nephroureterectomy (pT2 Nx M0 G2). Subsequent postoperative follow-ups (every 6 months for the first 3 years after surgery and then once every year) consisting of a clinical examination, total body CT scan, and regular endoscopic examination showed no evidence of recurrence and the patient did well until he noticed the painful penile nodule. Pathological examination of incisional biopsies confirmed the lesion to be urothelial carcinoma [Fig. ]. A subsequent CT workup revealed a 4-cm lesion localized in the upper-right pulmonary lobe and enlarged pelvic lymph nodes suggestive of multiple metastases.\nThe patient began combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine at 1250 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15, and then every 28 days for six courses) and external beam radiotherapy to the mass, which promptly relieved the penile pain. At an 8-month follow-up the patient was still alive with no remarkable changes to the pulmonary and lymph node metastases, or the penile swelling.",

The digital rectal examination revealed a benign feeling prostate of 40 g, the physical examination was negative and the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (I-PSS) was 21. The transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) indicated an isoechonic and homogenic enlarged prostate of 42 cm3 and the abdomen ultrasound found a modest splenomegaly and no peripheral lymphadenophaty. The peripheral blood count showed an elevated lymphocytosis (21.250/mL) with a differential of 65.3% lymphocytes, while other parameters as platelet count, number of erythrocytes and lactate dehydrogenase hormone level were all normal. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 3.38 ng/mL with a percent free PSA of 8.28%. Due to his age and symptoms, the patient underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological examination of the tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma in the prostate with a Gleason Score 4 (2+2) of less than 5% of the material (clinical stage T1a), associated with a diffused infiltration of chronic lymphocitic leukemia elements (see Figure ), CD5 and CD20 positive (see Figure ). The patient underwent a computed tomography of the abdomen, confirming only a moderate splenic enlargement but not lymphadenomegaly (stage 2 of Rai) and was then referred for a haematological evaluation. No other investigations or treatments were required due to the age, the low grade and stage of the disease in this patient. At a follow-up of 24 months the patient is alive, with a PSA value of 0.65 ng/ml, a stable haematological condition and the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (I-PSS) is 6.",

The catheter was changed easily by the specialist nurse and the patient was discharged home. He returned about ten hours later with features of peritonitis and feculent discharge along the supra pubic catheter. He underwent an emergency explorative laparotomy. A loop of small bowel \u2013 adhered to the scar \u2013 was placed between the anterior abdominal wall and the bladder. The supra pubic tract was seen to pass through and penetrate the loop in two places before going into the urinary bladder [figure ]. There was excessive fibrosis of the bowel segment in the area surrounding the perforation sites. Resection of the affected bowel segment and end-to-end anastomosis was undertaken. An indwelling urethral catheter was left in situ. He made a complete recovery and has been left with the urethral catheter.",

        "patient": "A 62-year-old woman was referred to the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department for treatment of a bleeding exophytic tumor located on the right inner canthus. She had had the lesion for approximately 11 years. Initially, the patient was treated with excision and primary closure ten years ago. At this time the tumor had a diameter of 5 cm. The tumor was diagnosed as adenoid BCC microscopically and surgical margins were tumor-positive. The patient was operated on two years later when the diameter of the recurrent tumor was 15 mm. Histological examination of this second specimen revealed an \"adenoid BCC\" with clear surgical margins.\nAlthough the tumor recurred again after the second excision, the patient neglected medical advice and did not undertake any treatment (Figure ). More recently, however, the tumor began growing rapidly and became hemorrhagic. On examination the lesion was located on the right inner canthus and involved 1/3 of the eyelid. The size of tumor was approximately 55 mm \u00d7 45 mm. Visual functions of the patient were normal. However, a fixed mass developed in the patient's periauricular area six months ago (Figure ), although there were no palpable cervical nodes. We therefore investigated this region with computed tomography (CT), which revealed a tumor involving the right orbital structures extending to the ethmoidal cells. The tumor also involved the right parotid gland and multiple cervical lymph nodes.\nWe also investigated this patient with a bone scan (normal), abdominal and cranial CT scans (also normal) and a thoracic CT. Multiple metastatic lesions were seen in the chest CT (Figure ).\nExaminations of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, urogenital and hematological systems and other parts of the skin were performed by physical and routine laboratory and radiological techniques. There were no abnormal findings. Biopsy was performed from the tumor located on the inner canthus and revealed \"adenoid basal cell carcinoma\" (Figure ). Also, Fine needle biopsies were performed on the parotid and pulmonary lesions which confirmed the presence of adenoid BCC in these regions.\nThe patient did not accept the offer of surgical treatment for the tumor on the inner canthus. She was referred to the Oncology Department and treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient received approximately 6000 cGy of external beam radiation over 3 weeks totally. Also, chemotherapy was initiated with cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. She was followed up with physical examination and CT scans for six months and there were no metastases to other organs. She is still being followed.",

He was emergently admitted and within 24 hours, a gross resection of the tumor was carried out. At surgery, following a parietal craniotomy, 50\u201360 cc of straw colored fluid was aspirated from the cystic component through a taut dura. After the excision of the dura, the bright area of enhancement previously noted was an area of tumor attachment to the dura in the parietal region. Otherwise, the tumor showed a well-demarcated interface with the subjacent normal brain parenchyma and a complete gross resection was achieved. A follow-up magnetic resonance image at 12 months post-surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence.

        "patient": "A 24-year old man was admitted to our hospital because of macrohematuria and general malaise, along with insidious deterioration of renal function. The patient had been diagnosed as having ventricular septum defect (VSD) without complications and had been well six months before admission, when the patient presented a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C and a productive cough. One month before admission, the patient was admitted elsewhere because of fever, general malaise, and macrohematuria. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the pulse was 120 beats per minute, and respirations were 24 times per minute. The blood pressure was 130/58 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient appeared acutely ill and pansystolic murmur of Levine III/IV was noted at the 4th left sternal border (LSB). The urine was positive for hematuria (+++) and protein (+++); the sediment contained 150\u2013160 RBC/hpf and 10\u201315 granular casts/hpf. Laboratory test revealed 2.04 mg/dl of serum creatinine, 33.3 mg/dl of BUN, and 9.0 g/dl of hemoglobin. Echocardiogram demonstrated VSD and vegetation on the tricuspid valve associated with regurgitation. The patient was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of renal dysfunction.\nOn the first hospital day, the temperature was 39.4\u00b0C and the physical examination demonstrated pansystolic murmur at the 4th LSB again, but no lymphoadenopathy and no localizing signs for a focus of infection. Laboratory findings were: anemia (Hb 8.6 g/dl, Ht 26.5%), presence of d-dimer (10.3 mg/ml), BUN 41 mg/dl, serum creatinine 2.49 mg/dl, proteinuria 0.96 g/24 h, 24 h Ccr 30.0 ml/min, hypocomplementemia (C3 29 mg/dl, CH50 16.5 U/ml), positive for inflammatory sign (CRP 2.8 mg/dl, ESR 104 mm/h), and positive for cryoglobulinemia (Table ). Antibodies for DNA, RNP, Sm, and myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 ANCA were normal (Table ). Echocardiogram again showed vegetation on tricuspid valve and TR (Figure ), suggesting the presence of right-sided bacterial endocarditis. However, there were no histories of tooth extraction, skin injury, or drug addiction and serology for viruses including HIV-1 was negative. Specimens of blood were obtained 5 times for culture and demonstrated Propionibacterium Acnes. A renal biopsy specimen showed typical crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figure ) with interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration on PAS staining. Ten of eighteen glomeruli had cellular crescents without fibrocellular and fibrous crescents. Immune reactants such as C3 (Figure ) and Ig M were found in peripheral capillary walls and in the mesangium.\nBacterial endocarditis complicated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was diagnosed and the intensive antibiotic therapy with penicillin G was started, without clinical improvement of renal function (on day 7 serum creatinine 6.21 mg/dl) or resolution of fever over the next 7 days. The initial antibiotics were replaced with ampicillin and imipenem in addition to low dose of corticosteroid treatment initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone 0.5-g per day for 3 consecutive days followed by oral prednisolone 30-mg, 20-mg, and 10-mg per day each for 3 days, respectively. On day 16, laboratory test demonstrated normalization of inflammatory signs (CRP 0.5, ESR 11 mm/h), serum complements, and circulating immune complex and negative for blood culture and cryoglobulin. After the short-term treatment of low dose of corticosteroid combined with continuous antibiotics, high fever and renal insufficiency were dramatically improved (Figure ). The antibiotic therapy lasted for 40 days until the day of the tricuspid valve-plasty and VSD closure. The patient was finally able to undergo the surgical operation, resulting in successful recovery from endocarditis-induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. He is now well and laboratory test showed normal serum creatinine 0.72 mg/dl, while echocardiogram demonstrated mild regurgitation of tricuspid valve.",

        "patient": "A 26-year-old woman presented with a 1 month history of a palpable mass in her left breast. Her mother died at the age of 31 years of breast cancer. Examination revealed a 2 cm firm and mobile mass in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast. The left axilla contained two enlarged palpable lymph nodes.\nMammography showed a 2 cm oval density that was homogenous with sharp margins. Ultrasound characterized the mass as solid but with a complex internal architecture. Fine needle aspiration of the mass was performed. It was positive for carcinoma, showing a very cellular sample with many malignant epithelial cells in cohesive groups, as well as lying singly in a background of necrosis and inflammation. The surgeon subsequently performed an excisional biopsy.\nGrossly, the excised mass measured 3.3 cm \u00d7 2.3 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm and appeared well circumscribed. The cut surface was grey and lobulated with variable fleshy and firm areas. Histological examination revealed a well-circumscribed biphasic neoplasm, consisting of proliferating stroma and compressed glands, displaying a well developed leaf-like architecture. The stroma was moderately cellular, mildly vascular, and lacked cytological atypia, mitoses, and stromal overgrowth. The features were consistent with a benign phyllodes tumor (figures &). More importantly, the epithelial component of the phyllodes tumor showed extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ, with multiple foci of invasive mammary carcinoma (figure ). The DCIS was of high nuclear grade, cribriform and micropapillary architecture, with (comedo-type) necrosis (figure ). The invasive carcinoma was of no special type, SBR Grade III/III (Score 8/9). Multiple tumor emboli were present within endothelial-lined spaces adjacent to the tumor, but the surrounding breast was otherwise unremarkable. Although the carcinomatous component was confined to the phyllodes tumor, the lesion was <1 mm from the nearest resection margin. Immunohistochemistry using smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and muscle specific actin demonstrated absence of the myoepithelial cell layer within areas of invasive carcinoma, and focal loss within areas of DCIS. There was intensely positive staining within 80% of tumor cells for estrogen and progesterone receptors.\nThe patient went on to have a left axillary lymph node dissection and subsequent pathological examination revealed 4 of 13 nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. She received adjuvant CEF (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, 5-Fluorouracil) chemotherapy and underwent further local excision to achieve wider margins; pathological examination was negative for residual tumor. She subsequently received local radiation and is currently undergoing tamoxifen therapy. The patient is presently alive and disease free, nearly three years after presentation.",

        "patient": "A 72 years old woman proceeded to the Emergency Department complaining of acute lower right abdominal pain, mild fever, mild weight loss and constipation. The past medical history of the patient was free.\nThe patient was presented with severe lower right abdominal pain, with signs of local peritonitis and a palpable mass in the same region. The body temperature was 37.2\u201337.4\u00b0C, while arterial blood pressure and cardiac rate 150/90 mmHg and 90/min respectively. The signs of local peritonitis combined with the palpable mass of the lower right abdominal area suggested perforation of the appendix and abscess formation. The laboratory examinations of the patient showed leucocytosis with white blood cell count (WBC) 19000 (with macrophage prevalence: 89%). Colonoscopy revealed obstruction of the right colon. Biopsies were not acquired because the colon lumen was obstructed and the endoscope could not approach the lesion. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen (Figure ) revealed a soft lobular mass, measuring 5 \u00d7 5 cm, attached to the ascending colon and cecum, compatible with a tumor. The most possible diagnosis was that of a perforated colonic tumor. The patient underwent explorative laparotomy and right hemicolectomy with an end-to-end ileocolonic anastomosis. Thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity revealed no other pathologic findings.\nThe surgical specimen consisted of a 10 cm length of the terminal ileum and the whole of the right colon. The serosa was very heavily covered by suppurative exudates and fibrotic tissue.\nMicroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed thickening of the ascending colon wall with neutrophilic infiltration. Numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes within the muscularis and a fibro-purulent reaction over the serosa with actinomycotic \"sulfur granules\" in it, were found in high power magnification (Figure ).\nUpon receiving the pathology report, systemic intravenous penicillin treatment was initiated. Therapy continued for 10 days and then followed by oral penicillin for 6 months. No postoperative complications were observed and the patient was discharged the 14th day.",

On day 3 after PBSCT, he was acutely ill with a chills, high fever (temperature 38.5\u00b0C), tachycardia (heart rate 108 beats/min) and increased respiratory rate (26 breaths/min). Clinical, radiological and microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed, and at three blood cultures were obtained from peripheral veins and catheter half an hour apart. The patient was empirically treated with intravenous imipenem/cilastatin, 2 g/day; and amikacin, 1 g/day. On day six after PBSCT, he had a persistent fever and the temperature spiked to 39.5\u00b0C. There was no sign of a catheter exit-site infection. Chest radiography was normal. Serial blood cultures taken from the catheter (two cultures) and a peripheral vein (four cultures) were positive for Micrococcus spp., which were identified as Kocuria rosea. An antibiogram showed that the pathogen was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, erythromycin and vancomycin. Imipenem and amikacin were discontinued, and intravenous vancomycin, 2 g/day was begun. The patient did not respond satisfactorily to vancomycin therapy for five consecutive days. The catheter was removed and a catheter tip culture was obtained. The cultures demonstrated a massive growth of Kocuria rosea. Blood cultures were thereafter negative. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 14 days of intravenous vancomycin. He was followed for six months; the patient is alive and well and is in complete remission of the primary disease.",

        "patient": "A 29-year-old woman was admitted our hospital on August 1999, had been diagnosed as mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy a year ago. She was followed up at a local clinic. On the follow-up study, the patient's CEA level was raised to 43.32 U/L and CT scan showed splenomegaly with cystic lesion. Her past medical history was not significant. She already underwent two surgeries. The first surgery, right salpingo-oophorectomy, was performed at the age of 22 after being diagnosed as dermoid cyst. She was healthy thereafter. Seven years later, left ovarian mass was found on the routine check. At the second surgery, left ovarian mass excision, mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy was diagnosed.\nDuring follow-up after the second surgery, she was referred to our hospital on the suspicion of carcinomatosis peritonei. On the preoperative evaluation (Figure ), splenic lesion, which had been existed for 2 years, was merely noticed as simple cystic lesion unrelated to the ovarian mass.\nTo exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis, open laparotomy was perfomed. On opening the abdomen, no abnormal gross findings were found except the splenic lesion, which reported as probable metastatic adenocarcinoma on frozen sections. After splenectomy was carried out, peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies on the omentum, peritoneum, mesentery, and left ovary were performed to rule out possible microscopic peritoneal dissemination. Suspecting the transabdominal metastasis, 100 mg of cisplatin was infused into the peritoneal cavity at the end of the operation; however no intraperitoneal recurrence was confirmed after tissue diagnosis.\nFinal pathologic examination (Figure ) showed metastatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies were all negative. The patient was recovered from the surgery without the evidence of sepsis of severe thrombocytosis. The patient received 5 courses of Taxol and Carboplatin as postoperative chemotherapy.\nTwo years after the surgery, 3 \u00d7 3-sized mass on the left ovary, which assumed to be recurrence, was detected. She has been followed up at outpatient department receiving symptomatic treatment and chemotherapy.",

        "patient": "A 66 year old male with history of rheumatic heart disease and aortic valve replacement (AVR) (twice for severe native and subsequent prosthetic valve regurgitation) presented with progressive worsening fatigue, exertional dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His other medical problems included poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Following his second AVR 4 years prior to this presentation, a routine follow-up 2-dimensional echocardiogram (TTE) had shown preserved left ventricular and prosthetic valve function and a aorto-atrial fistula with color flow between the aorta-and the left atrium. Notably, only a soft and short ejection murmur across the mechanical prosthesis was appreciated and no continuous murmurs were heard. This was felt to be a possible postoperative complication currently not of clinical significance given his asymptomatic status and he was treated medically and did well for the last 3\u20134 years.\nPhysical examination during this visit revealed an afebrile patient with a blood pressure of 138/84 mm Hg, regular pulse of 84/minute. An ejection systolic murmur (2/6 in intensity) was heard all over the precordium likely from the flow across his prosthesis. No continuous murmurs were heard. No evidence for clinical heart failure, anemia, jaundice or infection was noted. Laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis and blood cultures were negative. Given prior echo documentation of fistula and new symptomatology suggestive of heart failure, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was requested for more detailed assessment of prosthesis and AAF. TEE revealed normal left ventricular function, normal aortic prosthesis function with trivial aortic regurgitation. An echolucent area above the mechanical prosthesis, close to the left atrium near the orifice of the left coronary artery was noted. There appeared to be expansion of a portion of this lucency into the left atrium during systole suggesting communication with the aorta (Fig ) with turbulent color flow from the aorta into the left atrium (suggestive of AAF) throughout the cardiac cycle but mainly in systole as shown by color and continuous wave doppler (Figs and ). Compared to the prior 2-D echo there appeared to be mild left atrial dilation, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and significantly more prominent fistula flow suggesting either progressive shunting and enlargement of the fistula over time or underestimation by the prior 2-D echo. Although the echocardiographic findings mimicked changes which could also be related to endocarditis (abscess around prosthesis with pseudoaneurysm formation), the absence of any obvious vegetations or prosthetic malfunction combined with lack of clinical and laboratory evidence of endocarditis favoured a more slowly progressive postoperative complication rather than an infectious process. Based on his heart failure symptoms and progressive increase in AAF size and flow, surgical correction was recommended. He underwent uncomplicated surgical repair of the AAF which was found during surgery to be inferior to the left coronary ostium. No evidence of abscess or infection was found and the prosthesis appeared intact and healthy. The echo lucent area represented a postoperative weakening of the aortic wall adjacent to the left atrium, predisposing to the fistula formation and was also repaired. Intra-operative TEE showed no residual fistula by color flow at the site of repair.",

He was initially diagnosed with rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial impingement, and had a course of intensive physiotherapy followed by arthroscopic shoulder surgery, without improvement in symptoms. Two months later a minor incident involving his left shoulder led to an increase in pain and swelling and reduction in movement. Hydrodilatation was then performed but pain and function of the shoulder continued to worsen. On retrospective review of plain x-rays of the shoulder, a destructive lesion at the metaphysis with a cortical breach medially in the region of the surgical neck of the humerus was realized (Figure ). Further anatomic imaging showed an aggressive tumour mass in the proximal diaphysis of the humerus and humeral head extending into the adjacent soft tissues. He was referred to us, and subsequent biopsy of the lesion was consistent with a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. After a course of chemotherapy, the patient underwent en bloc resection of the tumour, via an extra-articular approach. Definitive histopathologic diagnosis was malignant fibrous hystiocytoma.",

        "patient": "A 45-year-old male was referred to our center with the diagnosis of suspected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the bowel in December 1999. He had generalized weakness for 2-years along with recurrent vomiting, occasional constipation and melaena for last 2 months. The diagnosis was considered after an ultrasound (USG) guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the intra-abdominal mass done elsewhere and showed features suspicious of NHL.\nAt presentation, patient's general condition was poor and he was dehydrated and pale. There was no peripheral lymphaedenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed an ill-defined, mobile, nontendor lump in left paraumblical region extending up to left lumber region. There was no hepato-splenomegaly. Examination of chest and cardiovascular system was normal. After initial resuscitation with crystalloids and blood transfusion, patient was further investigated.\nAt presentation his hemoglobin was low (6.4 gm%) but rest of the routine haematological investigations were within normal limit. The chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasound (USG) showed a left upper abdominal mass lesion suggestive of bowel mass. The upper GI endoscopy was normal. The barium meal follow through examination was suggestive of intussusception of proximal jejunum and a suspected mass lesion at the leading edge of intussusceptum. An USG guided core needle biopsy of mass was performed because of earlier suspicion of NHL, which showed smooth muscle bundles with areas of necrosis. Based on the above findings and biopsy report, patient was taken up for exploratory laparotomy 3 weeks after initial presentation.\nOperative findings revealed an intussuscepted proximal jejunum loop 12 cm distal to duodeno-jejunal flexure and a vascular polypoidal growth measuring 6.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3.5 cms on serosal surface of jejunum. Liver and spleen were normal. There was no evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphaedenopathy, ascites or peritoneal disease. The resection of involved segment of jejunum with 5 cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful.\nPathological examination of the specimen revealed two mass lesions measuring 4.5 cm & 3 cm in continuity (total 7.5 cm in maximum diameter) located on mucosal and serosal surface of jejunum respectively. Microscopically it showed spindle cell tumor with a mitotic rate of 5/10 high power fields (HPF). The tumor was negative for desmin, S-100, CD 34 and c-kit (CD117) but focally positive for actin on immunohistochemistry (IHC). The resection margins were free. The final diagnosis of malignant spindle cell tumor \u2013 leiomyosarcoma of jejunum was made. Due to negative margins and no evidence of disease elsewhere, no adjuvant therapy was planned and patient was kept on regular follow up. He was assessed clinically at three months interval and an USG of abdomen was performed six monthly. Patient remained disease free for 39 months. After that a follow-up USG showed a space-occupying lesion (SOL) in segment VII of liver and a mass lesion in left upper abdomen. The patient was asymptomatic and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality. A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen was performed which showed a 2 \u00d7 2 cms, brightly enhancing SOL in segment VII of liver (Figure ) and a 3 \u00d7 4 cms omental mass lesion abutting the bowel loop in left upper abdomen (Figure ). Upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any abnormality. A provisional diagnosis of recurrent leiomyosarcoma was made. Patient was planned for resection of the mass and RFA of liver lesion.\nPatient was explored and two separate well encapsulated, fleshy mass lesions were found in infracolic omentum, measuring 6 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 3.5 and 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cms. The liver lesion was not palpable and there was no evidence of disease at primary site or anywhere else in peritoneal cavity. An infracolic omentectomy along with tumor nodules was performed.\nThe histopathological features were suggestive of a highly cellular tumor composed of spindle shaped cells arranged in interlacing fascicles. On immunohistochemistry, multiple sections were negative for CD-34, CD-117, S-100 and desmin but focally positive for actin as in the initial tumor. So a diagnosis of recurrent leiomyosarcoma was made. The patient was taken up for an USG guided RFA of liver metastasis 3 weeks after surgery. The RFA was performed by Cool Tip\u2122 RF machine [Radionics, USA] using single tip probe. The procedure was conducted for 12 minutes at temperature of 65\u00b0C and the lesion was ablated with 1 cm margin. Follow-up CT scan done 3 days later showed complete ablation of metastatic lesion (Figure ). The patient was kept on regular follow-up and nine months after RFA he was asymptomatic and an abdominal CT scan showed no evidence of recurrence.",

        "patient": "A 77-year-old Italian female presented for evaluation of fever, stupor, diarrhea and vomiting of 3 days duration. She had no urinary symptoms. There was no history of head injury nor of previous surgical procedures. She had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years, for which she was being treated with steroids and methotrexate; other medical problems were insulin-dependent diabetes and moderate renal failure.\nOn admission, she was febrile (temperature, 38.0\u00b0C), alert but not oriented to time and place. Her neck was stiff, and she had a positive Kernig's sign. A CT brain scan showed an increase in subarachnoid space and in the volume of the ventricular system.\nLaboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell count of 15,100/\u03bcL with 70% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes. Results of urinalysis were unremarkable. Cultures of blood and urine were drawn and subsequently resulted negative.\nThe patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was opalescent with a glucose concentration of 14 mg/dl, a protein level of 472 mg/dl, and a white cell count of 200/\u03bcL with 95% polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 5% lymphocytes. Gram staining of CSF revealed no organisms. Pending the culture results the patient was empirically treated with intravenous meropenem, cotrimoxazole, acyclovir and dexamethasone.\nCulture of CSF yielded E. casseliflavus that was identified using the Vitek-2 system (bioM\u00e9rieux-Vitek) on the basis of 6.5% NaCl tolerance, bile-esculin hydrolysis, and growth rate at 45\u00b0C, arginine hydrolysis, methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside testing, and acid production from ribose, motility testing, and yellow pigmentation testing.\nThe isolate was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, teicoplanin, tetracyclines and linezolid; it exhibited intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin (MIC, \u22658 \u03bcg/mL), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC, \u226510 \u03bcg/mL), levofloxacin (MIC, 4 \u03bcg/mL), norfloxacin (MIC, 8 \u03bcg/mL), ciprofloxacin (MIC, 2 \u03bcg/mL) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC, 2 \u03bcg/mL); it was resistant to clindamycin (MIC, 4 \u03bcg/mL) and showed high resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin (MIC, \u22652000 \u03bcg/mL).\nThe patient became afebrile 48 hours after the beginning of antibiotic therapy with rapid improvement of her mental status and disappearance of meningeal signs (within 36 hours).\nOnce the organism was identified (4 days later), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acyclovir were discontinued and ampicillin-sulbactam (3 g every 6 hours) was added. After 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy the patient was discharged in good health with sterilization of the CSF culture. An echocardiogram revealed no vegetations whereas a colonoscopy examination showed two ulcerative lesions associated with two polyps, oedema and multiple punctuate erosions.\nEnterococcal infections of the central nervous system are quite rare and according to a MEDLINE search of the English literature only three cases of CNS infection by a motile Enterococcus identified as E. gallinarum have been previously documented; they occurred in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts for hydrocephalus [,]. E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum are responsible for 1\u20132% of all enterococcal infections and are characterized by the fact that they possess intrinsic low-level vancomycin resistance []. The VanC-1 ligase is specific for E. gallinarum, and the VanC-2/3 ligase is specific for E. casseliflavus []. Organisms with resistance to VanC remain susceptible to teicoplanin. This naturally occurring vancomycin resistance has not been shown to be transferable, and the related genes are chromosomally encoded in the members of these species [,,].\nDespite the intrinsic low-level vancomycin resistance exhibited by E. casseliflavus it is important to remember that most strains are susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. Combination therapy of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or streptomycin is considered the standard therapy of enterococcal meningitis due to ampicillin-susceptible strains []. Meropenem is not superior to ampicillin for therapy of enterococcal infections and most species of E. casseliflavus are beta-lactamase negative. There was not therefore a clear indication for the use of combination therapy with meropenem and a beta-lactamase inhibitor in the case reported.\nOur patient had gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, and colonoscopy revealed multiple erosions, which probably were the portal of entry of E. casseliflavus.\nIn fact, enterococcal meningitis may appear as a complication of diverse gastrointestinal diseases such as enterocolitis, peritonitis, abdominal surgery, or bowel carcinoma. A case of bowel erosions as the portal of entry of enterococcal meningitis has been previously reported [].\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of both hospitalized individuals and nonhospitalized healthy ones [,,]. Therapy with various antimicrobial agents, including cephalosporins and vancomycin, may play a role in increasing colonization with these organisms. Edlund et al. reported a significant increase in the emergence of E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus in healthy subjects who were administered oral vancomycin []. Our patient was not taking any antimicrobials before hospital admission. E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus/flavescens are part of the normal stool flora of the general population; this has perhaps impacted the ability of researchers to detect specific risk factors [].\nAlthough our patient had significant underlying conditions this case of meningitis was mild and had most of the typical features of \"spontaneous\" enterococcal meningitis (community-acquired infection, severe underlying diseases, and immunodepression).\nThe clinical significance of the enterococci that are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin has not been fully established yet. Infection with E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus has been associated with high mortality, but it is difficult to attribute their mortality directly to infection or to the underlying conditions of the patient.",

A decision was made after lengthy counseling to proceed with a laryngectomy 13 months following the implantation of Gore-Tex. Figure shows the Gore-Tex in the laryngectomy specimen.\nLight microscopy revealed a mild foreign-body giant cell granulomatous reaction with some associated fibrosis (Figures and ). The granulomatous response was limited to the periphery of the Gore-Tex and although it closely followed the profile of the material it did not encroach into or significantly break up the material. However, some fibrosis penetrated a short way into the Gore-Tex in a few areas. The giant cells were present mainly in a multinucleated form. Figure shows the Gore-Tex strip under crossed Polaroids showing birefringence of the implanted material. Birefringent fragments were only very occasionally seen within isolated giant cells. The giant cell response was mainly seen in areas where the end of a Gore-Tex strip formed a sharp corner. In one area a very small focus of metaplastic bone formation was seen.

        "title": "Sister Joseph's nodule in a liver transplant recipient: Case report and mini-review of literature",
        "patient": "A 59-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital for progressively enlarging but painless mass in the region of the umbilicus. The umbilical mass of approximately 5 cm in diameter and has developed two months after liver transplantation. The nodule was firm with irregular borders, wine-red shade and fixed to the surrounding tissues. The overlying skin was not ulcerated. She never smoked, consumed alcohol or used oral contraceptive pills. The gynecological history was unremarkable. The patient underwent a liver transplantation for end stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C in mid of 2003. Prior to the transplant, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) and CEA concentration were measured and both were within normal limits. The transplant procedure and immediate post-transplant period were unremarkable. The post-transplant immunosuppressive regimen consisted of Tacrolimus (6 mg/day) and steroids (prednisone 10 mg/day). Two months after transplantation, during routine follow-up, physical examination revealed multiple subcutaneous satellite nodules in close proximity to the umbilical region and lower abdominal wall. There was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A plain anterior/posterior chest x-ray was normal. Ultrasound of the abdominal cavity showed a 4 \u00d7 4 cm mass below the umbilicus and additional smaller nodules confined to the lower abdominal wall. Paraaortic lymph nodes were not identified. The echogenicity of the mass consisted of alternative hyper- and hypoechoic with poorly defined edges. However, the general condition of the patient was good and the laboratory test showed: hemoglobin level 9.6 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.1 mg/dl, Alkaline Phosphates 273 U/l, GGT 40 U/L, AST 36 U/L, and ALT 56 U/L. There was serological evidence of past hepatitis C virus infection. The biopsy of the umbilical mass showed features characteristic for a poorly differentiated serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma. An extended resection of the umbilical and paraumbilical metastasis was performed. In addition, extensive investigation to detect the primary neoplastic origin was initiated. Tumor marker evaluation consisted of: CEA 0.22 [normal 0\u20133.7 ng/ml], alpha feto protein 1.49 (normal: 0.8\u20139.4 UI/ml), CA125 27.73 (normal: 0\u201330 UI/ml), CA 19.9 was 8.61 (normal: 0\u201336.2 UI/ml), CA 15.3 was 22.48 (normal: 0\u201335 UI/ml). Multiple tumor marker measurements were obtained and each time similar results were reported. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was unable to demonstrate any lesion that could be considered a primary source of the metastasis to the umbilicus. Trans-vaginal ultrasonography showed a normal uterus and ovaries; ultrasonographic examination of thyroid and breast did not show any pathological changes as well. In spite of laborious efforts, the tumor's primary site was not found at that time. However, considering the histological results, the umbilicus metastasis could be attributed almost entirely to the ovarian cancer stage 4, since the main primary site in females are the ovaries. In order to prevent further tumor extension and expansion, tacrolimus was reduced from 6 mg/day to 1.5 mg/day. In addition, chemotherapy with Taxol was initiated (50 mg/m2 I.V) once a week for 16 weeks. To date, after 6 months of follow-up, the patient is doing well, the liver function is normal and tacrolimus serum level is 1 ng/ml. A recent whole body CT-scan showed regression of iliac and inguinal lymph nodes involvement.",

        "title": "First documented cure of a suggestive exogenous reinfection in polymyositis with same but multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis",
        "patient": "A 23-year-old polymyositis patient with suggestive clinical symptoms, muscle biopsy, enzyme assay, needle EMG and NCV test was on immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 weeks, tapered gradually over a period of 10 weeks to 1 mg/kg every alternate days and methotrexate at 7.5 mg weekly with gradual increase to 25 mg weekly for a period of 1 year when he experienced slightly improved muscle power.\nHe had single cutaneous abscess 6 months later on the right side of the neck with no sinus formation and cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. He was HIV-negative with normal CXR and there was no AFB in three consecutive (spot-early morning-spot) sputum samples (induced in two occasions). However, the aspirated pus from cutaneous abscess and biopsy of the axillary lymph node showed plenty of M. tuberculosis as culture was confirmed by niacin and nitrate reduction tests, rapid bacteriophage assay (FAST Plaque Tuberculosis kit, BIOTEC Laboratories Ltd, UK) and RFLP analysis (figure ) using species-specific probes for devR (Differentially expressed virulent gene) [].\nIn RFLP analysis, the devR gene (Gene bank nucleotide sequence accession no. U22037) encodes a response regulator that is part of a two-component signal transduction system of M. tuberculosis. The authenticity of the amplified product was established by hybridization of immobilized PCR products to an internal oligonucleotide, devR1, mapping within the devR gene. The chromosomal DNA was prepared by chloroform-isoamyl alcohol DNA extraction and 4.5 \u03bcg of DNA from the isolate was restricted with PvuII. Separation of PvuII-restricted DNA by electrophoresis, Southern blot hybridization with a 513-bp PCR probes for devR (devRf, 5' GGTGAGGCGGGTTCGGTCGC 3'; devRr, 5' CGCGGCTTGCGTCCGACGTTC 3') and chemiluminescence detection were done according to the standard method recommended for the DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis []. Histopathologically there were nonspecific necrosis with disintegrating polymorphs, very few granulomatous cells and no epithelioid cells in the biopsy specimen. USG of kidney, liver or spleen revealed no abscess. The strain was susceptible to the 4 first line drugs [isoniazide (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z)] by BACTEC 460TB system. Treatment with 4-drug regimen (H = 300 mg/d, R = 450 mg/d, E = 800 mg/d and Z = 1.5 g/d) for 8 months (2EHRZ/6HR) [] with first 2 months supervised showed clinical improvement.\nHowever, the patient returned 6 months later with multiple cutaneous abscesses, mainly on his back, left thigh and left arm and miliary mottling in CXR. He denied any irregularity in antituberculosis therapy. All immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids and methotrexate) were discontinued as he was readmitted. Isolates from 2 of 3 consecutive sputum samples and aspirated pus samples from all 5 completely drained abscesses were reconfirmed as the identical M. tuberculosis strain by phage assay and RFLP analysis (figure ). The isolate was resistant to 4 first-line drugs by BACTEC 460TB system and to 9 drugs, tested into Loewenstein Jensen media (Hi-media, Mumbai, India): H (1 \u03bcg/ml), H (10 \u03bcg/ml), R (20 \u03bcg/ml), R (50 \u03bcg/ml), E (2 \u03bcg/ml), E (10 \u03bcg/ml), Z (50 \u03bcg/ml, at pH 5.5), streptomycin (5 \u03bcg/ml), streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml), paraaminosalicylate (2.5 \u03bcg/ml), cycloserine (30 \u03bcg/ml), amikacin (700 \u03bcg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (12.5 \u03bcg/ml). Treatment was continued with H (5 mg/kg/d), R (10 mg/kg/d), Z (30 mg/kg/d), E (15 mg/kg/d), kanamycin (15 mg/kg IM 5 times weekly) and sparfloxacin (500 mg/d) for 18 months with first 2 months under supervision. A slow but complete clinical, microbiological and radiological cure after 1.5 year was followed up for another 16 months.",

        "patient": "A 32-year-old white male presented with nausea, vomiting, crampy lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. His initial lab values were hemoglobin 15.6 g/dl (14\u201318 g/dl), hematocrit 45.8% (40\u201354%), sodium 131 mEq/l (135\u2013146 mEq/l), potassium 3.9 mEq/l (3.5\u20135.5 mEq/l), bicarbonate 24 mEq/l (22\u201324 mEq/l), chloride 91 mEq/l (95\u2013112 mEq/l), BUN 37 mg/dl (7\u201325 mg/dl), serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl (0.7\u20131.4 mg/dl), and normal liver function tests. He was treated with intravenous fluids, Ciprofloxacin and anti-emetics, to which the diarrhea resolved in 2\u20133 days. After one month he had recurrent watery diarrhea accompanied with rectal pain, bleeding and vomiting. He also developed fever of 101.6 F.\nThe physical exam was remarkable for decreased bowel sounds and moderate lower abdominal tenderness. There were no masses or organomegalies palpable. The rectal exam was remarkable for tenderness and heme-positive mucus. The remainder of the physical exam was uneventful. Stool samples from the initial visit were positive for Clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and depicted many WBCs (neutrophils 99% and eosinophils 1%), suggesting an infectious etiology. Stool sample was negative for giardia lamblia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, aeromonas and plesiomonas. There was no predominance of staphylococcus, yeast, or pseudomonas.\nThe patient was initially started on Ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid.) for 3 days without symptom resolution. Metronidazole was added (250 mg tid.), but intolerance of the patient to metronidazole with exacerbations of nausea prompted the replacement to Vancomycin (250 mg qid) in conjunction with Ciprofloxacin for 7 days. During this initial treatment period, the patient characteristically developed migratory polyarticular joint pain and swelling involving the shoulders, elbows, fingers, hips and knees. Lack of response to antibiotics suggested an autoimmune disease as a contributing factor.\nAt this time a sigmoidoscopy and pinch biopsy revealed diffuse acute and chronic inflammation with cryptitis, mucin depletion, and glandular foreshortening and branching suggestive of UC (Fig. ). The patient was treated with Asacol (400 mg bid.) in conjunction with metronidazole (250 mg qid). After 7 days of combined therapy with continued weight loss and no improvement, prednisone (60 mg qid.) was added, resulting in cessation of GI symptoms and moderate improvement in joint pain and swelling. After 7 days of continued improvement, the antibiotic and Asacol therapy were stopped. The patient was maintained on high dose steroids for 14 days. However, fever, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms recurred upon tapering of prednisone to 20 mg a day. When symptoms recurred, a stool culture was negative for infectious agents including Clostridium difficile antigen, confirming an autoimmune component to disease pathology in this patient. Prednisone was increased to 30 mg per day at which point gastrointestinal symptoms resolved but joint swelling and pain continued. Over the course of 3 months prednisone tapering was attempted three additional times, with each resulting in symptom recurrence.\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the patient experienced an acute dental abscess and was prescribed a combination vancomycin (250 mg tid) and metronidazole (250 mg tid). During this period, the patient was able to gradually reduce prednisone dosage without symptom recurrence. Antibiotics were continued for 30 days during which time prednisone was tapered completely. Symptoms did not recur and the patient remained symptom-free without further therapeutic intervention for 4.5 years.\nAfter this prolonged period of remission of UC symptoms, a second episode similar to the first occurred. The patient once again presented with bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and joint pain. Stool cultures were Clostridium difficile positive by culture and cytotoxin. Once again the patient was treated with 60 mg daily of prednisone and metronidazole (250 mg tid). Symptoms did not resolve, and vancomycin (125 mg tid) was added, resulting in a significant improvement in symptoms. After 2 weeks of combined therapy metronidazole treatment was stopped and symptoms recurred within a week. Metronidazole was once again added, leading to resolution of symptoms. Combined antibiotic and steroid therapy continued for 2 months during which time prednisone was tapered completely and a second remission of UC symptoms was induced.",

        "patient": "UG was a pretty seventeen-year old girl in March 2003 when she was interviewed by a locally trained interviewer. She looked, however, visibly ill and strained -quite unlike a normal happy young woman. She complained of constant headache and pain in her eyes. UG's PTSD diagnosis was confirmed within a two-week period by an expert using the CIDI.\nUG did not wait to be offered treatment, but came herself to the project centre and requested for help. In her own words, \"I have been to all the doctors but they have done nothing for me. All they give me are painkillers. I had to drop out of school because of my headaches and pain in my eyes.\" When the treatment protocol was explained to her, she was enthusiastic about relating her experiences and readily gave her assent. Her mother was quick to give her consent. She said she would try anything that would help her daughter. In her own words, ' My daughter has not been her real self for a long time.'\nAt the beginning of NET 1, UG drew a picture of the Somali flag. Asked to explain, she said she loved her homeland and hoped to go back there one day when there was peace. While laying her lifeline, UG included a happy family life in Somalia till the age of 4, her arrival in Uganda after a long and difficult flight itinerary and being accepted as a refugee by the UNHCR as the flowers in her life. The stones in her life represented the worst event, when her older brother was killed, her sister was severely injured and her two younger brothers were lost, never to be seen again, to date. Other stones symbolised flight difficulties such as extreme hunger, and a failure to access a solution for her headaches and eye pain, which she has had since the worst event.\nIn subsequent NET sessions, UG talked in detail about these events. Excerpts from her story read:\nI was born on August 26th 1986 in Mogadishu.... I had six brothers, two younger than me and two sisters older than me. We were a very happy family. As a big family, we conversed a lot and made jokes. We were very happy with our father. He made us laugh and brought us presents whenever he went anywhere. This was a happy time till I was 4 years old...\nOne day,... we heard guns and bullets firing and we were excited. My father ran from work and picked up the other children from school and came back home with them. Some people came to chase us away from our house because we were a minority clan (Madiban). They were from the Hawie (Habrigidir). They were men, very many. They told us to leave everything and flee from the house. They did not beat us. I was still a child, with a soft head. I heard the bullets and started vomiting and fell down. My mother picked me up and put me on her back. We all left the house...\nOn the way, we met very many militia men dressed as army men. They told us to lie down on the ground. I was still crying. The rest were silent. One of them knocked me with the butt of the gun on the soft part of my head. Then I kept quiet. They wanted to kill everyone...\nThey put us in a house for security purposes. A heavy gun was shot near the house. There was another house near our house. They shot this house and the fragments reached our house. Some people were killed in our group, including my brother. He was older than me. He was called Mahad. He was in his school uniform. He fell down on his stomach. I did not see him fall but I saw the blood. My sister Khadija was lying down when the fragments hit her. I did not see any blood, but the fragments went into her stomach and she was hurt in her stomach. My father thought she was dead, but people said she was still alive and she was still talking. He went to her and told her to get up. She could not get up. My father carried her to the hospital. Two of my brothers, Abdirahman aged four years, and Abdirasaq aged three years, disappeared in that group as everyone ran away. They were my two younger brothers. My dead brother Mahad was left there. We never saw my two brothers who disappeared again. So many other people died as well...\nAfter one year, we came back to Mogadishu. We found our father and sister in the hospital. They first stayed in the hospital for some time, then moved to a house. My sister had been operated on. My father had become a bit deaf because of the gunshot.\nWe decided to leave Somalia and go somewhere else more secure. We left Somalia with nothing. My mother, my father, my injured sister Khadija, and the other six children...\nWe went to Kampala. My mother was advised to go to the UNHCR and got a mandate. My sister Shamso and my cousin sister Fardosa also got separate mandates.... In 1997, we were resettled in Nakivale camp...\nI hit my head down and I felt the pain of the gun again. I was not hurt but I got a terrible headache for three days. I went to the doctor but I did not get any assistance except Panadols and eyedrops. Since then, I was unable to go to school because the headaches increased. My eyes had begun paining from birth, but they increased with the headaches.\nI am still here but I hope for a better future and a happier life e.g. to be resettled elsewhere, to have an education, to have a happy family of my own and to make contact with my lost loved ones.\nAmong her hopes and aspirations for the future, UG hoped to trace her missing brothers under the auspices of the Red Cross, as well as re-enter the education system. She also hoped to one day have a happy family of her own\nIn the final picture at the end of therapy, she drew a happy family inside a nice house, living in peace.\nUG had a CIDI pre-test sum-score of 16; immediately after treatment, this reduced to 12 in the CIDI post-test and 1 at the nine-months follow-up. The nine months follow-up found UG no longer in the camp but in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. She looked happy and cared about her appearance. She said she had no more headaches, and little eye problems. In her own words, \"I feel like a newborn child,\" she told the blind evaluator. She had moved away from the camp to explore possibilities for further education, resettlement and to seriously try to trace her brothers. She also reported joining other adolescents when they were out to socialize. \"My biggest dream is to play soccer myself, but as a girl, I would never be allowed. But at least I go and cheer to the boys when they play.\" She says her family members, especially her mother, have all noticed the difference in her and keep commenting on the improvements she has made. She is more like any healthy young woman.",

        "title": "Spontaneous rupture of giant gastric stromal tumor into gastric lumen",
        "patient": "A 75-year-old diabetic male presented with dull upper abdominal pain of one-week duration. He noticed swelling in left upper abdomen. There was no history of vomiting, fever or gastrointestinal bleeding. He had no significant medical or family history and was non-smoker and non-alcoholic. Physical examination showed a 14 \u00d7 10 cm mass palpable in epigastrium and left hypochondrium with minimal intrinsic mobility.\nRoutine biochemical investigations were normal. Ultrasonogram and CT-scan of the abdomen showed large heterogeneous mass of 13 \u00d7 10 cm extending from the tail of pancreas to anterior pararenal space, lesser sac to gastrosplenic ligament enveloping the posterior aspect of fundus, body and greater curvature (Figure ). One day after the admission, examination showed reduction in the size of palpable mass to 8 \u00d7 6 cm size which was not associated with aggravation of the symptoms. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was repeated which showed reduction in the diameter of mass to 8 \u00d7 8 cm. Upper endoscopy showed large bulge in fundus and corpus of the stomach posteriorly with an opening in the posterior part of the corpus with edematous margin with dissemination of serous fluid and necrotic material in to the stomach (Figure ). Fluid analysis was normal for CEA and CA 19-9. Biopsy taken from the edge of the opening showed bundles of spindle cells with elongated nuclei and tumor cells (Figure ) and was strongly positive for CD117 immunohistochemical examination, diagnostic of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (Figure ). At laparotomy a large tumor was seen arising from the posterior wall of stomach measuring 8 \u00d7 8 cm, which has ruptured into the gastric lumen, and was infiltrating the upper pole of spleen, anterior capsule of pancreas and mesocolon. He underwent total gastrectomy and splenectomy with esophagojejunostomy, and segmental transverse colectomy. Histopathology of resected specimen showed large spindle cell GIST with >5/50 HPF (high-power field) mitotic activity. Postoperative period was uneventful. Postoperatively he was put on imatinib mesylate 400 mg once daily. Patient is asymptomatic on follow up for 11 months.",

        "patient": "A 24-year-old woman presented to the surgical clinic with epigastric pain, feculent vomiting and post-prandial diarrhoea of three months duration; she had lost over one stone in weight. She was previously healthy and was not taking any regular medications. There was no history of peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma or previous abdominal surgery. She had been investigated two years previously by a gastroenterologist for intermittent left-sided abdominal pain at which time the clinical examination and blood tests were normal. Irritable bowel syndrome had been diagnosed, although no colonic imaging was performed. Both her maternal grandfather and great-grandfather had suffered from colonic cancer.\nAn initial ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed thickened bowel in the right upper quadrant with a dilated duodenum. A barium meal and follow through was then performed: this demonstrated a mucosal abnormality on the greater curvature of the stomach with a fistulous tract into the transverse colon (Figure ). Barium enema and colonoscopy were not performed. The presence of a mucosal abnormality on the greater curvature of the stomach was confirmed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy although initial biopsies revealed no evidence of a malignant neoplasm. Her blood tests revealed: haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl, mean cell volume 71.6 fl and a white cell count 20.2 \u00d7 109/l; urea, electrolytes and liver function tests were all normal.\nIn view of her symptoms, an exploratory laparotomy was undertaken. At surgery, a large mobile tumour of the distal transverse colon was identified; this was adherent to the greater curvature of the stomach, the mesentery and to several loops of jejunum. A radical en-bloc resection was performed involving a subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy and small bowel resection (Figure ). The patient made an uneventful recovery from surgery. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon without lymphatic involvement (Dukes' Stage B): this was adherent to and had penetrated the stomach wall. She received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (420 mg/m2) and folinic acid (20 mg/m2) chemotherapy every four weeks for the following six months.\nShe has been followed-up with two-yearly colonoscopy and five-yearly upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. She remains well with no signs of either local or distant recurrence more than ten years after initial diagnosis.",

Physical examination on admission revealed a fist-sized subcutaneous tumor in the inguinal region. The overlying skin appeared normal without ulceration (Figure ), and there was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography depicted a solid tumor with heterogeneous contrast enhancement in the adipose tissue, and no metastases to the liver and lung (Figure ). With a tentative diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma of unknown origin, a wide local excision (with a resection margin \u2265 20 mm) was performed.\nThe resected tumor, measuring 124 \u00d7 105 mm, was solid, encapsulated, and a homogeneous yellowish white in color, without central necrosis and hemorrhage on its cut surface. Routine histological examination with hematoxylin-and-eosin revealed that the tumor comprised spindle-shaped cells with high cellularity in parts (Figure ) and two mitoses per 10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry with mouse monoclonal antibodies against desmin (D33, Dako Cytomation Japan Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), alpha-smooth muscle actin (1A4, Dako Cytomation Japan Co.

As the tumor cells showed only immunoreactivity for desmin (Figure ) and alpha-smooth muscle actin, a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma of subcutaneous adipose tissue origin was confirmed.\nThe patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. As the resection margin was negative, no adjuvant treatment was given. He remains well with no evidence of disease 5 years and 8 months after excision.",

He had been reviewed regularly by the oncologists and remained asymptomatic until the onset of frank haematuria.\nHe subsequently underwent cystoscopy, which revealed a solid bladder tumour on the right lateral wall, which was treated with trans-urethral resection. Pathological examination confirmed a poorly differentiated mucus-secreting adenocarcinoma, identical histologically to the original oesophageal tumour (Figures and ).\nA diagnosis of metastatic oesophageal adenocarcinoma to the bladder was made. A CT scan did not demonstrate any pelvic tumour outside the bladder and therefore metastasis by the trans-coelomic route was essentially excluded, indicating haematogenous spread of the primary oesophageal carcinoma.

        "title": "Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after amoxycillin-induced anaphylactic shock in a young adult with normal coronary arteries: a case report",
        "patient": "A 32-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room of the local Health Center because of anaphylaxis, which developed 2 hours and 15 minutes after the ingestion of amoxycillin (500 mg), prescribed by his dentist. Prodromal signs of anaphylaxis (flushing, pruritus, warmth, urticaria) reportedly occurred about 15 minutes before the onset of symptoms from other systems. Ten days earlier the patient, an asthmatic since childhood, had completed a 4-day course of amoxycillin (500 mg TID) without any side effects. Apart from obesity, there were no other risk factors for coronary artery disease.\nOn admission the patient was in acute distress. He was complaining of dizziness, blurred vision, dyspnea and abdominal pain. Initial examination revealed an obese man (Weight = 130 kg, Body Mass Index = 38 kg/m2) with generalized erythema, angioedema, cyanosis and diffuse wheezing; the systolic blood pressure was 70 mmHg and the pulse rate 120 bpm. The patient was then connected to a cardiac monitor, which showed sinus tachycardia (approximately 140 bpm) without ST-segment and T wave abnormalities (Fig. ). Pulse oxymetry demonstrated an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90%.\nEpinephrine (0.3 mg or 0.3 ml of a dilution 1:1000) was injected subcutaneously (SC); dimethindene (4 mg) and hydrocortizone (500 mg) were administered intravenously (IV) in slow infusion. Nebulized salbutamol and supplemental oxygen were given as well. Normal saline with 50 mg ranitidine hydrochloride and Ringer's solution were infused through separate intravenous lines.\nDue to unsatisfactory clinical response (persistence of hypotension and tachycardia, despite improvement of the pulmonary signs) a second dose of epinephrine (0.2 mg) was given SC 20 minutes later. Almost simultaneously with the administration of the second dose of epinephrine, ST-segment elevation appeared on the monitor (Fig. ) and the patient complained of substernal chest pain. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V3 to V6 (Fig. ). A single dose of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid was given per os; heparin (5000 UI) and pethidine hydrochloride (25 mg) were administered IV. An hour later the patient was hemodynamically stable. The arterial blood pressure was 125/90 mmHg and SpO2 rose to 96%. However, the chest pain persisted and nitroglycerin titrated at a dose of 25 \u03bcg/min was infused IV, without complete symptom relief. At this point the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of the nearest general hospital.\nTreatment in the CCU included thrombolysis with reteplase \u2013 administered according to the standard protocol \u2013 2 hours after the onset of chest discomfort, which according to the established clinical and electrocardiographic criteria was considered successful []. The peak levels of serum troponin I and creatine phosphokinase were 45.5 ng/ml (normal = 0\u20132 ng/ml) and 575 U/L (normal = 25\u2013195 U/L), respectively; while the MB fraction was 77 U/L (normal = 0\u201324 U/L). The rest of the laboratory results, including serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Lpa and triglycerides, were within normal limits. An ECG performed before discharge showed complete loss of potentials in leads III and aVF and partial loss of potentials with a small q wave in lead II (Fig. ). An echocardiographic study performed on the 5th hospital day showed preserved systolic function (ejection fraction 60%) without wall motion abnormalities. Left (Fig. ) and right (Fig. ) coronary angiography showed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease; left ventriculography was normal as well. The patient recovered completely and was discharged a week after admission. He was referred to the adult Allergology Center of our area performing diagnostic work up for drug allergy.\nPrick skin tests (PST) were performed using penicilloyl polylysine (PPL), and minor determinant mixute (MDM) [supplied as Allergopen by Allergopharma (Reinbeck, Germany)]; amoxycillin, ampicillin and cefamandole solutions were also used (concentration 20 mg/ml) for PST. PST were strongly positive [4+ reaction (on a scale of 1\u20134) i.e. wheal >5 mm in diameter with pseudopodes, with no reaction at all to the diluent control] to amoxycillin and ampicillin. Intradermal tests were performed only to PPL, MDM (dilution 1/10) and cefamandole (0.2 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml) and resulted in strongly positive reaction (4+) only to the MDM. Circulating specific IgE to penicillin V, penicillin G, amoxycillin, ampicillin and cefaclor was not demonstrable by CAP (Pharmacia, Sweden).",

        "patient": "A seventy-year-old male patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and concomitant arterial hypertension was referred to our institution for LA circumferential ablation. The preprocedural TEE described an aneurysm of the IAS (See : TEE.mpeg for the TEE), however the left heart catheterization was deemed feasible. ICE performed at the electrophysiology laboratory (catheter Ultra ICE 9900, 9 MHz, EP Technologies, Boston Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA, USA connected to a console ClearView Ultra, Boston Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA, USA) as a routine part of the transseptal puncture showed more detailed picture of the intracardiac anatomy \u2013 dilated aortic root, enlarged right atrium displacing the IAS towards the LA free wall, and small oval fossa with flapping motion of the fossa ovalis membrane. The distance between the IAS and the LA free wall during the atrial diastole was small (Fig. ). During the atrial contraction the LA cavity appeared almost obliterated and the fossa ovalis membrane virtually touched the LA free wall, thus making the transseptal puncture potentially dangerous (Fig. ) (See : ICE1.mpeg for the unusual intracardiac anatomy). The fossa itself was abouting anteriorly to the non-coronary aortic sinus of Valsalva and although the fluoroscopic position of the transseptal needle was apparently correct, ICE showed that it was always sliding to the junction between the IAS and the aorta and that the needle tip was pointing towards the aortic root. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to change its direction towards the oval fossa. That was also deemed a condition predisposing to complicated transseptal puncture (Fig. ) (See : ICE2.mpeg for the sliding of the transseptal needle towards the aorta). During the procedure two echocardiographers, including the one, which had performed the TEE, re-evaluated the videotaped TEE and agreement was achieved that the initial interpretation of the TEE needed correction. Although the patient was symptomatic and the arrhythmia episodes could not be suppressed effectively with antiarrhythmic drugs, after considering all pros and cons we decided not to perform the left atrial procedure and thus to avoid serious and potentially fatal complications. Only a cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was done.",

        "title": "Locally advanced duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma treated with adjuvant radiation therapy: case report and review of the literature",
        "patient": "A 49-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of melena. During the preliminary consultation, she also complained of right upper quadrant pain, which radiated to her right lower quadrant and upper back. She underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy which demonstrated a 3 cm, ulcerated, ampullary mass (figure ). Endoscopic biopsies suggested the diagnosis of paraganglioma. The lesion did not obstruct the ampullary orifice. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen failed to demonstrate this lesion or any additional abnormalities.\nThe patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and lymph node dissection. The postoperative course was uneventful except for delayed gastric emptying diagnosed by frequent vomiting during postoperative days 7 to 10, and confirmed by gastrograffin swallow. These symptoms eventually resolved with conservative management and the patient was discharged from the hospital on 15th postoperative day.\nGross pathological evaluation of the resected specimen included a portion of duodenum with ampulla, measuring 16 cm. in length, and a portion of pancreatic head measuring 5 cm. in length. There was a polypoid periampullary mass protruding into the duodenal lumen, measuring 1.4 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 0.7 cm. On cut section, the mass was moderately firm and pink-tan. It was circumscribed but unencapsulated, and appeared to be covered by normal appearing duodenal mucosa. There was no evidence of pancreatic invasion by the tumor. A total of seven lymph nodes were also removed, 5 peripancreatic (3.0 cm in greatest dimension) and 2 periduodenal (1.2 cm and 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, respectively).\nHistologically, the tumor consisted of a complex neoplastic proliferation that included a component resembling carcinoid or islet cell tumor (figure ), admixed with a proliferation of spindled neurofibrillary cells and larger polygonal cells demonstrating gangliocytic differentiation (figures and ). There were areas of stromal hyalinization resembling amyloid, with focal calcification (figure ). Congo red and Thioflavin T stains were negative for amyloid. The tumor extended through the muscularis propria and along the common bile duct, but did not invade the pancreas. The resection margins were free of tumor. Metastatic paraganglioma was present in 6 of 7 periduodenal and peripancreatic lymph nodes. The metastatic lymph nodes showed the same mixed histologic features as the primary tumor.\nImmunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the tumor stained positively for S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and cytokeratin AE1 and AE3. No reactivity was observed with MART-1 or HMB 45. Staining for c-kit (CD 117) was performed on sections of the primary tumor and of one of the lymph nodes with metastatic tumor. The carcinoid-like epithelial cells and the spindle-shaped neurofibrillar cells stained negatively for the cell marker c-Kit. The gangliocytic cells stained strongly positive for c-kit.\nDue to the evidence of regional lymph node metastasis the patient was counseled regarding adjuvant therapeutic options. The treating physicians queried recognized experts in the field of radiation therapy for gastrointestinal malignancies via email and a consensus developed that external beam radiation therapy might be reasonable, although it was admitted that no data are available regarding the use of this modality for this disease entity. Ultimately, a decision was made to administer external beam radiotherapy to the abdomen in an effort to eradicate any possible residual disease not removed during surgery and to reduce the risk of locally recurrent disease. No chemotherapy was advised due to the rarity of distant metastases and the lack of response of these neoplasms to conventional systemic therapy.\nThe patient was treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in 28 fractions of 180 cGy/fraction over 37 elapsed days; 6 mv photon beam energy was used. The target was a postoperative tumor bed with a 5\u201310 mm margin. The total dose was 5,040 cGy. She tolerated treatment well and is now symptom free more than one year following resection. Surveillance CT scans and endoscopy have been performed both of which reveal no evidence of recurrent disease.",

In the past, he had suffered from several episodes of pneumonia which started at the age of seven months. On admission, laboratory findings included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84 mm/h, WBC count 12100/mm3 (61% neutrophils, 39% lymphocytes), hemoglobin 11.3 gr/dl and thrombocyte 386000/mm3. As the CRP analysis displayed 20 mg/dl, cephalexin (150 mg/kg/day) was initiated. In his roentgenogram, osteolytic lesions in the distal metaphase of hand and maxillary bone were observed. Considering history of several infections and multifocal osteomyelitis, bone biopsy was performed and his immune system function was evaluated. In the bone biopsy, non-necrotizing granulomatoid lesions were seen. The induration of purified protein derivative reaction was 10 mm diameter. Besides, HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs), rheumatoid factor and brucella agglutination tests were all negative. The serum IgG level was 1650 mg/dl (normal: 441\u20131135 mg/dl). IgM and IgA were in high normal range at 250 and 175 mg/dl, respectively. Because no defect was found in his humeral and cellular immunity, the phagocytic cells function was tested with a nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) slide test. Based on his hematological and immunological tests (NBT = 0), CGD was considered as underlying disease in this case. Regarding his NBT test, antibiotic therapy was changed from cephalexin to co-trimoxazole (20 mg/kg/day, iv) plus (along with) interferon-\u03b3 (50 microgram/m2 every other day). After two weeks of treatment, the patient's condition improved and he was discharged with prescription of both cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day) and co-trimoxazole (10 mg/kg/day) to be taken orally as prophylaxis.\nThe patient was readmitted to our center after eight months with a tender mass in his right upper quadrant (RUQ) (Fig ). On admission, his major complaint was severe dyspnea, a persistent cough and also chest and abdominal pain in epigastric area which was started 10 days ago. He was placed on antibiotic therapy including cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day). A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen was performed which revealed the hypodense area in liver (Fig ). Adjacent to this opacity, involvement of lower right ribs and reaction to soft tissue were also observed, indicating ribs osteomyelitis. After sonography guided drainage of the above-mentioned hepatic abscess, a sample was sent to the Mycology Department in Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The microscopic examination of clarified specimen with KOH 10% indicated the branched, septated and dichotomous mycelia (Fig. ). The remaining specimen was also cultured on Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI), Sabouraud's dextrose agar (S) and Sabouraud's containing 0.005% chloramphenicol (Sc). The S and Sc culture media were incubated at 25\u00b0C and BHI at 37\u00b0C. The colonies grew rapidly, attaining the diameter of 5 cm within 5 days and their color was bluish green. Cellophane tape preparations and slide cultures demonstrated septated, branched and hyaline hyphae with rough-walled conidiophores and radiated conidial heads. Based on these microscopic and macroscopic findings, Aspergillus fumigatus was determined as causative agent in this case. Deoxycholate Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day, iv), interferon-\u03b3 (50 microgeram/m2 every other day, sc) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) were administered with diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The only adverse event observed during treatment was hypokalemia, which was adjusted by administration of potassium chloride 15%. One month after initiation of antifungal therapy, his follow-up CT scan of the abdominal and thoracal region demonstrated relative resolution of hepatic abscess. After four weeks of intravenous treatment, the patient's clinical condition improved. He was discharged upon his parents' responsibility while continuing taking rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) for two more weeks as a treatment in addition to co-trimoxazole (5 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (4 mg/kg/day) as long term prophylaxis.",

        "patient": "A 33 year old male presented with decreased vision in the left eye and left sided headache of 3 months duration. Examination revealed left eye blindness with primary optic atrophy and no other neurological deficit. Imaging revealed a bony tumor in the left ethmoid sinus invading the left orbit and compressing the left optic nerve. Intracranial extension into the anterior cranial fossa on the left side was noted (Figure ). Core biopsy of the mass showed an osteoid osteoma.\nA multispeciality team approach was devised to achieve radical excision of the tumor. Bicoronal scalp flap and pericranial flaps were raised separately. A single burr hole left fronto orbital bone flap was raised including the orbital roof and left zygomaticofrontal process (Figure ). Dura was retracted and the bony hard whitish tumor visualised. This was excised using the high speed drill (Figure ). Weber Ferguson incision was used to access the orbital portion of the tumor. Medially the tumor could be felt in the orbit but retraction of the globe was difficult. Hence inferior orbitotomy was done by removing the lower and lateral orbital margins. The intraorbital contents could now be retracted laterally and the tumor visualized (Figure ). The tumor was then detached from the ethmoid sinus and the intraorbital extension excised. The ethmoidal portion was drilled and radical excision achieved (Figure ). Dural tears were covered with temporalis fascia and glue. The ethmoidal sinus was packed with free temporalis muscle graft. Vascularised pericranial graft was used to cover the anterior skull base. The frontal sinus was exenterated and packed with gelfoam. The bone flap and orbital margins were replaced.\nPost-operatively patient had a frozen left eye (possibly due to retraction of the orbital contents) with no improvement in the left eye vision in the immediate postoperative period. His postoperative period was otherwise uneventful. Histopathological examination revealed an osteoid osteoma (Figure ). On follow up after 12 months patient was disease free (Figure ).",

        "title": "Necrotic gangrenous intrathoracic appendix in a marfanoid adult patient: a case report",
        "patient": "A 43 year old female district nurse presented to the accident and emergency department with a 6 hour history of initially generalized abdominal pain which was localizing to the right. This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nA likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C \u2013 reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )\nShe was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision. There was a small amount of free fluid but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only with no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum. The right iliac fossa wound was closed and we proceeded to an exploratory laparoscopy.\nAt laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum were it felt to be tethered. This suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest. The procedure was abandoned and a CT thorax and abdomen were performed to define the anatomy involved.\nThis (Figure , ) demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions of moderate size with underlying unexpanded lungs. The liver had what appeared to be a large Reidl's lobe. Behind the right liver lobe, the right kidney was markedly elevated and the ileo-caecal junction appeared to lie between the liver and the kidney. The right side of the colon appeared to lie above the liver. Three dimensional reconstruction of the scans demonstrated absence of the right hemidiaphragm. (Figure , )\nThe symptoms and signs persisted and a laparotomy was performed. At laparotomy, there was some free fluid. There was definitely a large defect in the right hemidiaphragm. The right liver lobe had grown right up into the right intrathoracic space. There was a large hernial sac beneath the right lobe of the liver between the common bile duct, duodenum and liver, displacing the right kidney medially and containing transverse colon, terminal ileum, caecum, appendix and free fluid. The contents of this sac were successfully reduced and a perforated gangrenous appendix with pus was found within the intrathoracic hernial sac. A standard appendicectomy was performed. The right colon was formally mobilized, fully reduced and the caecum was fixed within the right iliac fossa.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively where she made a good recovery. She had instant relief of her abdominal symptoms and post-operative contrast study demonstrated the presence of the right colon within the abdomen (Figure ). She was discharged a week post-operatively.",

Six months after the diagnosis, she started chemotherapy for four months, and reduction of tumor mass was observed. One month after the end of chemotherapy, the tumor was removed. Macroscopically, tumor mass measured 5.0 \u00d7 4.0 \u00d7 3.8 cm and was involving uterus, pericolic tissue, and vagina. Histological analysis shows also involvement of both ovaries and large bowel wall. Ten out of 13 lymph nodes showed metastasis of DSRCT. The peritoneal fluid colleted during surgery was negative for neoplastic cells. Eight months after the first surgery, she presented with a recurrence in the abdominal cavity and a new resection of the tumor mass showed involvement of cecal appendix. Peritoneal fluid sample collected at that time was positive for malignant cells. In the follow up examination, seven months after the second surgery, it was found an inguinal tumor mass of 15 mm. FNA was performed and showed DSRCT metastasis. After the diagnosis, this patient was transferred to another institution.",

        "patient": "A thirty two year old female was admitted with a three hour history of epigastric pain radiating into her back in keeping with biliary colic. She had vomited a number of times. In the previous week she had two episodes of a similar nature.\nOn examination there was no jaundice or pyrexia. The apex beat was in the right fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. She had epigastric tenderness but was not tender in the right or left upper quadrants. Her white cell count and amylase level was normal but her C-reactive protein level (CRP) was elevated at 290 mg/L. An electrocardiograph showed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy, in keeping with dextrocardia.\nAn ultrasound scan of the upper abdomen identified the gallbladder, which contained stones, in the left upper quadrant. The spleen was visualised in the right upper quadrant. There was no evidence of common bile duct or intrahepatic duct dilatation. Chest X-Ray confirmed the clinical and electrocardiograph diagnosis of dextrocardia.\nThe diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and situs inversus was made. The patient settled clinically over two to three days and was discharged home to be admitted electively for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nIn order to conduct the laparoscopic cholecystectomy all theatre equipment including diathermy, monitors and CO2 insufflator were positioned in the mirror image of their normal position. The surgical team also changed sides with the primary surgeon and first assistant on the patients right and the second assistant on the left. The ports were inserted in the usual way but on the left side. At laparoscopy the entirety of the abdominal contents were indeed reversed.\nThe main difficulty encountered was that the primary surgeon, who was right handed, would have had to cross hands to retract on Hartmann's pouch while dissecting Calot's triangle. We overcame this difficulty by allowing the first assistant to retract on Hartmann's pouch, while the primary surgeon dissected Calot's triangle using his right hand via the epigastric port without hindrance. The common bile duct and cystic duct were identified, as was the cystic artery, which lay anterior to the cystic duct. The surgery proceeded without incident and the patient recovered and was discharged the next day.",

        "title": "Case report: Greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis",
        "patient": "A 20-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was admitted for elective surgery of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. The first surgical step consisted of a subtotal removal of the tumour by a transfrontal approach. An EVD was inserted at day 1 (D1) because of the appearance of hydrocephalia.\nAt D10, the second approach consisted in a transoral resection of the tumour with a reconstruction of the pharyngeal wall with skin taken from the arm. However, the wall was not totally occlusive, with a continuous CSF leak into the pharyngeal cavity. Seven days later (D17), the patient developed meningitis with fever and a white blood cell count of 13,800/mm3. CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain showed CSF leukocytes at 830/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 0.99 g/l and a CSF glucose concentration of 3 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A Ps. aeruginosa O12 resistant to almost all antibiotics except ceftazidime and polymyxin B, similar to that repeatedly found in the oral cavity, grew in CSF culture. It was therefore decided to replace the ventricular drain with another in the controlateral hemisphere for two purposes: first, to withdraw CSF to reduce CSF leakage by the fistula, and second, to perform a biochemical and bacteriological analysis. Antibiotherapy was started with intravenous (i.v.) ceftazidime (6 g/day for 2 days, followed by 8 g/day for 25 days) combined with amikacin and polymyxin B both in the ventricles.\nA clear improvement in the meningitis allowed us to perform the third and last approach (at D42): an occipito-cervical fixation procedure with EVD removed. Three days later (D45), the patient developed a new episode of hydrocephalia. It was therefore decided to introduce ELD rather than EVD.\nTwelve days later (D57), the patient developed a second episode of meningitis: fever, lumbar CSF leukocytes at 14,000/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 1.88 g/l and a glucose concentration of 0.9 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A CSF culture found the same bacteria as in the first episode of meningitis. This second episode was considered to be related to the persistent pharyngeal fistula. The ELD was replaced with a new one and EVD was added because of the suspicion of an additional obstruction in the 4th ventricle related to post-surgical oedema. Meningitis was treated with an increasing dose of i.v. ciprofloxacin (from D61 to D95: 1.2 g continuously over 24 hours for 4 days, followed by 2.4 g over 24 hours for a further 31 days) and i.v. cefepim (from D61 to D95: 4 \u00d7 2 g/day for 4 days to 4 \u00d7 3 g/day for a further 31 days; see below for the inhibitory minimal concentration and the plasma and CSF concentrations of antibiotics) and amikacine and polymyxin B colistine both administered directly into the ventricles.\nThe third episode of meningitis appeared at D66 with identification of the same Ps. aeruginosa O12 in CSF culture, increased CSF protein and decreased CSF glucose levels in both ELD and EVD. Antibiotics were kept constant and, despite negative cultures, ELD and EVD were replaced with new drains. Interestingly, since this last episode of meningitis, the pharyngeal fistula disappeared, which indicated the end of pharyngeal contamination of CSF. The patient improved rapidly and was discharged home at D108. No further episode of meningitis during the next 3 years, nor any toxic effect related to the high doses of antibiotics, was observed. It is noteworthy that repetitive cerebral computed tomography scans showed no empyema.\nFigure shows the time course of the following parameters: leukocyte counts, glucose and protein concentrations, measured in parallel in CSF from EVD and ELD, for 17 days (D57 to D73) corresponding to the second and third episodes of meningitis. Figure shows strikingly that the leukocytes and the protein concentration were always higher and the glucose concentration was always lower in ELD than in EVD. Interestingly, the highest ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradients in leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration were present at the very acute phase of meningitis, when Ps. aeruginosa O12 was present in the meningeal cavity.\nOur case also showed that the increase in the amount of antibiotics given did increase their concentration in plasma but not in CSF. Indeed, i.v. cefepim was increased from 8 to 12 g/day and i.v. ciprofloxacin from 1.2 to 2.4 g/day from D64 to D95. This induced a persistent increase in plasma cefepim concentration from 46 \u03bc g/ml to more than 60 \u03bcg/ml and plasma ciprofloxacin concentration from 0.2 \u03bcg/ml to more than 1.0 \u03bcg/ml. However, only a transient increase in cefepim concentration (D63, 7 \u03bcg/ml; D73, 15 \u03bcg/ml; D81 and D95, less than 9 \u03bcg/ml) and no increase in ciprofloxacin concentration (0.4\u20130.5 \u03bcg/ml from D63 to 95) were seen in lumbar and ventricular CSF. It is noteworthy that the inhibitory minimal concentrations of cefepim and ciprofloxacin for Ps. aeruginosa O12 were 16 and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively.",
