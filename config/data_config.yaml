#needed for adding data paths 
#It's a configuration file that stores all settings related to your data - paths, preprocessing rules, and dataset splits.

#e.g.
#paths:
 # processed_data: "./data/processed"          # Cleaned narratives
 # json_outputs: "./data/json_outputs"         # LLM extractions
 # train_file: "./data/splits/train.jsonl"
 # val_file: "./data/splits/val.jsonl"
#  test_file: "./data/splits/test.jsonl"
